         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T cannot ſeeme ſtrange, that I who have lately given my ſelfe to the ſervice of your ſoules, ſhould now dedicate my Booke to you for that purpoſe. Nor can any wonder, ſince you have lately imitated your Predeceſſors, in the loving and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous Call of your (though now un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy) Paſtor; that he ſhould endeavour to follow the ſteps of thoſe excellent ſervants of Chriſt your former Miniſters, who in their times both by Preaching and Printing beſtowed their labours upon you for your ſpirituall benefit.</p>
            <p>I have frequently heard, that <hi>Black-fryars</hi> is one of thoſe places in <hi>London,</hi> commonly accounted and called by the name of <hi>Priviledged,</hi> in reſpect of ſundry ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Immunities beſtowed upon it. But what are all thoſe Political, in compariſon of the Spiritual priviledges which God hath afforded to you of this place? in regard whereof I much queſtion, whether any Congregation in <hi>London</hi> (I
<pb facs="tcp:166919:3"/>think I may take a far larger compaſs) hath been equal to you in the priviledg of enjoying ſo long a continuance of an Able, Orthodox, Soul-ſaving Miniſtry. Thoſe two ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and eminently faithful Servants of Chriſt, Mr. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerton,</hi> and Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> (lately deceaſed) ſpent (as I am informed) about <hi>ſeventy</hi> years in their Miniſterial La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors among the people of <hi>Black-fryars.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Goſpel in your Congregation hath continued (I think) beyond the remembrance of the oldeſt, (the Lord grant that it may outlive the youngeſt) now living among you. God hath, as it were, made his Sun to ſtand ſtill upon your <hi>Gibeah,</hi> and his Moon upon your <hi>Ajalon,</hi> to give you light to overcome your ſpirituall Enemies. How many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and pithy expoſitions, ſavoury diſcourſes, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent tractates have had their conception in your Pariſh, and their birth in your pulpit! You have enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the monthly adminiſtration of the Lords Supper, (as your late reverend Paſtor informed me) theſe five and forty yeares, without any interruption. I mention not theſe things to occaſion your <hi>glorying in men,</hi> or any outward priviledges, but onely to put you upon <hi>ſelf-reflexion,</hi> and holy <hi>examination,</hi> how you have thriven in holineſſe under all theſe enjoyments: Church privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges (I grant) are excellent mercies, in their kinde: Without the Ordinances, places are commonly as void of <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility</hi> as <hi>Chriſtianity;</hi> They are but <hi>magna latrocinia, dens</hi> of robbers, and places of prey, <hi>darke places of the Earth fill'd with violence.</hi> Church-priviledges, (ſo far forth as they are viſibly owned) make men <hi>viſible</hi> (ſaints in oppoſition to the <hi>world;</hi> yea and in their due and holy uſe, <hi>real</hi> and true ſaints in oppoſition to <hi>hypocrites.</hi> But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all theſe, the meanes of grace, without grace by thoſe meanes, leave thoſe who injoy them, in the ſame condition (in reſpect of any ſaving benefit) with thoſe who want them.

The higher <hi>Corazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida's</hi> elevation was, the greater was their downfall. Juſtice will pluck the unreformed, from the <hi>Altar</hi> of privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. Sermons do but heat hell, and Sacraments are but oyl and pitch to make its flame ſcald and conſume the more painfully. The barren oak was not ſo <hi>near curſing,</hi> as the <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren fig-tree.</hi> Nor are weeds on the <hi>dunghill</hi> ſo near plucking up, as thoſe in the <hi>Garden;</hi> by none is the name of God ſo much diſhonoured, mercy ſo much abuſed, hypocriſie ſo odiouſly vei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the power of godlineſſe ſo bitterly hated,
<note place="margin">Joh. 8.33. Rom. 1.27.</note> as by many who have moſt enjoyed Church priviledges. Put not off your ſouls therefore (dear Chriſtians) with outward Priviledges without inward grace by thoſe Priviledges. What is it more to have a <hi>name to live,</hi> and to be <hi>ſpiritually dead,</hi> to have titular ſanctity and real impiety, then for a ſtarving man to be v<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When God had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon <hi>Abram</hi> a <hi>new name,</hi> and changed it to <hi>Abraham</hi> he gave him alſo a new bleſſing. The unprofitable under the means of grace, are therfore worſe then thoſe who want thoſe means, becauſe they are not better, the more aſhip is laden with gold, the deeper ſhe ſinks, the more you are laden with golden priviledges, the deeper (if you miſcarry) wil be your deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion Though the Miniſters induſtry without ſucce<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

He may be <hi>ſincere,</hi> yet unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfull; but then the people in the mean time, if unprofitable, ſhew themſelvs hypocritical. You never commend your Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters but by getting the ſaving impreſſions of what they preach upon your hearts. Chriſt reproved the young man for calling him <hi>good Maſter,</hi> becauſe (ſaith <hi>Calvin</hi>) he had
<pb facs="tcp:166919:4"/>never received any ſaving good from Chriſt. The ſheep onely prayſe the care of the carefull ſhepherd, by their wool, milk, fruitfulneſſe and fatneſs. Let it never be ſaid, that God gives the food of life to you, (as a rich man gives a nurſe good dyet for the benefit of his child) onely for the thriving of ſtrangers. Be not as <hi>Indians,</hi> who go naked and beggarly in the midſt of all their heaps of gold. Let not ſermons be as jewels onely to hang in your ears, but let them be lockt up in the cabinets of your hearts. Conſider, ordinances are never yours, till you get the ſavour of them upon your ſpirits; Meat upon the table may be taken away, but not when by eating, 'tis turned into a mans ſubſtance. Books may be ſtoln out of a Scholars ſtudy, but a thouſand theeves can never take away the learning which he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten into his head, by ſtudying thoſe Books. The <hi>grace</hi> of priviledges is onely ſafe. You ſhall be ſtript of theſe when you come to dye, but the grace of them will ſtick by you for ever. Chriſt may ſay to thoſe at the laſt day, <hi>depart,</hi> who have <hi>eat and drunk</hi> with him, and <hi>caſt out devils,</hi> but never will he ſay ſo, to thoſe who having eat and drunk with him, have alſo eat and drunk himſelf, who have caſt luſt out of their ſouls, and gotten a broken heart for ſin, or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the leaſt dramme of ſanctifying grace. Oh how much is a drop of inward holineſſe, better then a ſea of <hi>outward</hi> priviledges!</p>
            <p>This book with which I here preſent you, is the ſecond part of my Expoſition upon the divine and excellent Epiſtle of <hi>Jude.</hi> The Apoſtles ſcope in writing this Epiſtle was to ſtir up theſe Chriſtians to oppoſe thoſe who would have ſeduced them to libertiniſm, and to <hi>contend for the faith,</hi> againſt <hi>thoſe who turned the grace of God into wantonneſſe,</hi> who allowed themſelves to live, or rather (like beaſts) to wallow in all filthineſſe, under pretence of advancing free grace; and who laboured to make the Saints by being <hi>Chriſtians</hi> to become <hi>Heathens,</hi> as the Apoſtles had made them of <hi>Heathens</hi> to become <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor of ſatan was to drive people from one extream to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:166919:4"/>and ſince he could not by keeping ſome under Judai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>w they had liberty to be as had as they would, and that the worſe they were, the better they were, &amp; the lower they were in ſin, the higher in Chriſtian perfection: And hence it was that theſe later Epiſtles (one of the laſt whereof this of <hi>Jude</hi> was) are principally ſpent in oppoſing a feigned, workleſs lifeleſs faith, and in adminiſtring antidotes againſt thoſe doctrines of prophaneneſs and libertiniſm, wherewith the times grew the more infeſted, as the doctrine of grace grew the more to be cried up and advanced.</p>
            <p>It is now a compleat year ſince I began to put pen to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for the preparing this ſecond Part for the preſſe: And it might long ſince have been finiſhed, had not my many other employments hindred. It hath coſt me (I confeſs) ſome ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious hours; but the kind acceptance which my other Part hath found from the Church of God, encouraged me to look beyond the difficulty of the work, and made me unwilling to leave this Commentary longer unfiniſhed. I ſhal conclude with my earneſt &amp; humble ſupplication to the <hi>Father of lights</hi> that this endeavour (among others) may advance the ſpiritual progreſs of the Church, and principally of you (my dear and beloved friends) ſo in grace here, that you may be fitted for glory hereafter.

If all be well with the ſoul, all is well with the man, though the body be never ſo miſerable: If it go ill with the ſoul, the man is wretched, let the body be never ſo happy. The funerall of a noble man is much ſpoken of; when a Prince dies, all lay it to heart; when his Page dies, it is never regarded: The body, the ſouls page, is not to be lamented, from which the ſoul parts; but the ſoul, from which God himſelf parts.

The worſt things which befall the body, may be ſent in mercy; they part between us and contemptible enjoyments, yea, oft they make way for the enjoying of the beſt bleſſings; but they which befall the ſoul, ſever from him in whom all bleſſedneſſe is laid up: ſpiritual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts or miſeries are true, real; the temporal of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are but opinionative. <hi>Fear not him,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>that can kill the body, but fear him that can throw both body and ſoul into hell.</hi> To conclude, Spiritual judgments are alway inflicted in diſpleaſure, in the laſt place, as the foreſt of all, as a reckoning for all other faults, when all other chaſtiſements are deſpis'd: when God is ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercy, the laſt mercies are the beſt; and the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he goeth in mercy, the ſweeter he is and when he is puniſhing, the laſt puniſhments are the foreſt; and the further he goeth, the bitterer he is: the judgment of <hi>pining away in iniquity</hi> is the laſt of all that diſmal cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, <hi>Lev.</hi> 26.39.

The wicked man ſleeps and loves to ſleep, laies himſelf to ſleep, ſhuts the door, draws the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines, puts out the candle, chargeth that none wake him; but a Saint is like a man overtaken with ſleep againſt his will, who is ſurprized with it, as with an armed man; and being never ſo ſound aſleep, but he is <hi>between ſleeping and waking,</hi> he alwaies even then fears he ſleeps, and wiſheth he were awaked, and would be glad, if any would take the pains to rouze him, though by making the loudeſt noiſe, and giving him the moſt violent jog; yea will gladly accept of the ſmarteſt blows, and the bloodyeſt ſtripes; that the Lord laies upon him, if by all he may be awakened from his ſlothfulneſſe.

How wofull is that Hell into which a ſinner falls by preſuming of Heaven! Its a Hell upon earth, for ſinners to dream that they are going to Heaven. An imaginary happineſs in ſin occaſions a doubled wo and miſery for ſin: when our natural dreams are falſe, its better they ſhould be of bad then good, of fearful things then of joyful. Its better for a <hi>King</hi> to dream himſelf to be a <hi>beggar,</hi> then for a <hi>beggar</hi> to dream that he is a <hi>King;</hi> for when the King waketh, his grief is gone, and his joy is doubled, he then ſeeing the vanity of his dream; but when the Beggar wakes, his former grief is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and returns the fiercer, by reaſon of the falſe joy of his dream. And thus it is in the deceitful dreams and dotages of the heart: far better is that deceit whereby a ſon of God thinks himſelf a ſlave of Satan, then that whereby a ſlave of Satan dreams himſelf a member of Chriſt. Better it is for <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> being a man to think himſelf a beaſt, then for a beaſt to think himſelf a man. A mans falſe conceit of miſery when indeed he is happy, doth not make him miſerable, but rather occaſions his happineſs; but a mans falſe apprehenſion of happineſs, he being miſerable, is ſo far from making him happy, that it makes him doubly miſerable. To conclude this, as nothing is ſo calamitous, as to dream of happineſs when we are in miſery, ſo nothing is more common; Its natural for men to think too well of themſelves, to nullifie others, and to deifie and omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie themſelves.

The <hi>Schoolmen</hi> following <hi>Dionyſius, Gregory,</hi> and others, groundleſly aſſert, that the Angels are diſtributed into <hi>three ranks and Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies;</hi> and that every one of theſe three, contain three ſeveral orders apiece. The firſt of the three <hi>ranks and Hierarchies,</hi> they ſay, comprehends <hi>Cherubims, Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, and Thrones;</hi> The <hi>ſecond, Dominions, Principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leties, and Powers:</hi> The <hi>third, Mights, Archangels, and Angels.</hi> Nor do they only ſhew their boldneſſe in ranking and dividing them thus into theſe <hi>three Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies</hi> and nine orders, (for how can they preciſely aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert that they ſhould be thus marſhal'd in rank and file, diſtributed and divided after this manner, and that there are juſt ſo many and no more orders of Angels?) but they preſume to tell us the reaſons of all theſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall appellations, and to ſet down the ſeverall proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and offices which are allotted to all theſe orders of Angels, whereby they are diſtinguiſhed among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. The <hi>Seraphims</hi> (they ſay) are ſo called, becauſe they are inflamed, and inflame others with extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary and ardent love to God. The <hi>Cherubims</hi> are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from their excelling in the light of knowledg: The <hi>Thrones</hi> are ſuch who contemplate and adore the judiciary equity and righteous judgments of God; and the <hi>Angels</hi> (ſay they) who are contained in this firſt <hi>claſſis</hi> or order, are never ſent forth (a bold aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and contrary to Scripture; which ſaith, <hi>they are all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation</hi>) upon any miniſtry or imployment,

He hath an Art to accuſe for that, whereof himſelf and his are moſt guilty; thus he accuſed <hi>Joſeph</hi> of Inconti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency, <hi>Elijah</hi> of troubling <hi>Iſrael, Chriſt</hi> of being an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy to <hi>Ceſar;</hi> yea, of that, to which the Accuſed are moſt <hi>contrary,</hi> as in thoſe inſtances appears, accuſing e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Sun of darkneſs. And God hereby makes their integrity more apparant, either here or hereafter: Slanders are but as ſoap, which though it ſoyles for the preſent, yet it makes way for whiteneſs: The Sun of their good fame ſhall break out gloriouſly from under the cloud of ſlanders; God will <hi>bring forth their righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as the light,

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:166919:32"/>which is but too ready to fall upon the graces of Saints. The <hi>Divel</hi> is <hi>Satan,</hi> and therefore he is a <hi>Divel;</hi> he is an <hi>Adverſary</hi> to Chriſt, to Holineſs: what will not malice ſay?

The Divel is a <hi>Serpent,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he is an Accuſer; he hath ſubtilty to invent, as well as malice to utter his ſlanders. He is the <hi>god of the world,</hi> and hath the tongues of wicked men at his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand: if he ſaith to one, <hi>Go, it goeth, &amp;c.</hi> He hath found the ſucceſsfulneſs of this Engine of accuſation, he hath murdered thouſands with it, and thereby ever brought Religion into ſuſpition and diſgrace; he hath many receivers, he wil therefore thieve away the names of Saints; his calumnies eaſily enter, and hardly depart.</p>

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> This adverſary may here be called a <hi>Divel,</hi> an <hi>Accuſer, becauſe he accuſeth a man to himſelf,</hi> and that in <hi>two</hi> reſpects: 1 He makes a man <hi>think better of himſelf then he ſhould;</hi> tells him he is going to <hi>Dothan,</hi> when he is going to <hi>Samaria;</hi> that the way to Hell is the ready way to Heaven. As <hi>Abſolom</hi> told the people flatteringly, <hi>Thy cauſe is good;</hi> ſo he, Thy caſe is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py: Strangling them oft with a ſilken halter. 2 He makes men think their eſtate <hi>worſe</hi> then it is, by ſtret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſins which he hath drawen them to commit, beyond all the meaſure of Mercy, and poſſibility of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, to bring the ſinner to deſpair. Thus he dealt with <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas.</hi> He who once told men, they might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent when they would, and it would be time enough hereafter to call for Mercy, now affrights them with apprehenſions that the day of Grace is at an end, and that it is too late to make their peace with God.

Whoſe only work is to pull down, and pluck up, to tear and rend; to lay gins and ſnares, not for beaſts, but men; to <hi>ſearch out iniquities, and to accompliſh a diligent ſearch:</hi> who are <hi>skilful to deſtroy,</hi> but ignorant how to build up. How unlike are theſe to him who went up and down <hi>continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally doing good?</hi> It likewiſe diſcovers the goodneſs and power of God, in ſtopping this <hi>hurtful</hi> Creature, in bounding him within his <hi>limits,</hi> in <hi>binding him in chains</hi> of reſtraint; ſo that though he <hi>wils</hi> to do what (nay more then) he <hi>can,</hi> yet he ſhall <hi>never</hi> do what he <hi>will,</hi> nor often what he <hi>can.</hi> It teacheth us to make him our friend who only hath care and goodneſs to countervail the Divels cruelty.

Nor do we find in Scripture, (and here in this place the contrary is clearly manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) though holy Angels were often employed as the Meſſengers and Miniſters of God againſt the wicked, to withſtand them, and to execute upon them Gods judgements, that they at all cenſured them, but ever they left the judging of them to God; a practice ſutable to a gracious perſon, and acceptable to God, who though he requires publick, yet forbids private judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. When he calls and ordains any to judge others, and to paſs ſentence upon them for their offences, 'tis their duty to perform his pleaſure, though with the diſpleaſing of any; but when he calls them not, they muſt not judge others for the pleaſing of themſelves. Publick Judgment is required by God of Magiſtrates, for the ſuppreſſion of Injuſtice, and the protection of the innocent; but private judgment paſt upon others, it being without any lawful call from God, meerly out of private revenge and perſonal hatred, is frequently in Scripture forbidden, and here by <hi>Michael</hi> forborn. His work was a work of <hi>ſervice,</hi> not of <hi>Judicature.</hi> He was <hi>fellow creature</hi> with this (though <hi>evil) Angel,</hi> not a <hi>fellow Judge</hi> with <hi>God. Michael</hi> and the <hi>Divel</hi> were now both pleaders before God, and God only was to paſs ſentence. <hi>Michael</hi> oppoſed the practice and attempt of the Divel, and might judge it evil; but he cenſured not his perſon, a work which he left to God: though the <hi>Divel</hi> deſerved to be judged for his ſin, yet <hi>God</hi> deſerved not to be <hi>robbed</hi> of his glory; and <hi>Michael</hi> would not do a work, which God never com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionated

There are three grounds of fear to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture upon any way, or courſe propounded to us. 1. <hi>A natural</hi> deſire of our own preſervation, cauſing a dread of any thing which may endanger it: This in it ſelf is no ſin, it having been, not onely in the holieſt men, but in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> himſelf, who prayed, that if it were poſſible, <hi>the Cup</hi> of death might <hi>paſs from</hi> him. 2. That <hi>corruption</hi> of nature, whereby the creature feareth <hi>nothing</hi> but the ſmart of puniſhment, and ſhuns it only
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:166919:57"/>as it is <hi>afflictive</hi> to ſenſe, not at all as it is <hi>offenſive</hi> to God; the Party thus fearing, having an heart onely filled with guilt, and ſelf-accuſation, and empty of that faith which <hi>worketh by love:</hi> Thus the Divels <hi>believe and tremble.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That Principle of grace,</hi> whereby perſons fear ſin as its oppoſite, and diſpleaſing to God, whom they dare not offend; not onely becauſe he ſets himſelf <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſin,</hi> but principally, and in the firſt place, becauſe ſin ſets it ſelf <hi>againſt God:</hi> This was the holy fear of <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> 119.12. <hi>My fleſh trembleth becauſe of thee, and I am afraid of thy judgements.</hi> Firſt he feared <hi>God,</hi> and then he ſtood in awe of his <hi>judgements.</hi> This is indeed to fear ſin <hi>as</hi> Hell, and not onely to fear it <hi>for</hi> Hell This is that fear commended by <hi>Solomon,</hi>

                  <p n="1">1. The way of hypocriſie. <hi>Cain</hi> indeed offered a ſacrifice to the Lord, and perhaps (though ſome deny it) every way as <hi>good</hi> and coſtly (in reſpect of the <hi>outſide</hi> thereof) as was that of <hi>Abel;</hi> yet he ſacrificed in a faithleſs <hi>hypocritical</hi> manner, as is clear from the <hi>reaſon</hi> why <hi>Abels</hi> ſacrifice was better, and better accepted with God then <hi>Cains;</hi> and that reaſon rendered by the Apoſtle, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. was becauſe <hi>Abel offered in faith;</hi> by which <hi>faith,</hi> he <hi>offering a better ſacrifice,</hi> and better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, its plain that <hi>Cain</hi> ſacrificed not in <hi>faith,</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a good work, but with a rotten and hypocriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal heart; not <hi>inſpirit and truth</hi> worſhipping God. The faith of <hi>Abel</hi> in offering his ſacrifice, ſtood principally in two things: 1. <hi>In eying the rule</hi> and command of God obediently, who had enjoyned it. 2. In expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>acceptation</hi> from God for the Merit, not of his <hi>work,</hi> but of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was ſignified by his ſacrifice. Of both theſe, <hi>Cain</hi> though ſacrificing, was deſtitute, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther offering becauſe he believed the <hi>Command</hi> of God was to be obeyed, nor in offering, looking to find <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance</hi> for his Perſon and performance through Chriſt; but prophanely, cuſtomarily, and proudly doing the <hi>thing</hi> which God commanded, but diſregarding the <hi>manner</hi> commanded in doing it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. A <hi>ſecond way of Cain,</hi> and that principally (as I conceive) here intended by our Apoſtle, was the <hi>hatred and murder of his brother,</hi>

He ſlew him not ſtirr'd up by any ſudden rage, heat or commotion of mind, or by imprudence; but out of ſetled hatred and in a way of <hi>ſtudy</hi> to take away his life. 7. This murder was committed by <hi>Cain,</hi> after God <hi>had admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd</hi> him to take heed of that ſin. 8. And after he had made a <hi>ſhew of friendſhip</hi> and reconciliation to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Cain talked</hi> (viz friendly and familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) with his brother, and then he ſlew him. Hence this inhumane murder, is that ſin for which by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John, Cain</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>of that wicked One,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.12. In ſhort, Firſt he inwardly hated and envyed his brother, becauſe his ſacrifice was <hi>better accepted</hi> than his own; and then he expreſſed this hatred, by his cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty in killing him. His hatred, was murder begun; and his murder, was hatred perfected. He, who cared not how he ſerved God, regarded not how he uſed his brother. <hi>Cain</hi> begins with ſacrifice, and ends with murder. There were in the whole world but two bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and the one was a Butcher of the other; <hi>Abel</hi> was the firſt <hi>Martyr,</hi> and <hi>Cain</hi> the firſt <hi>Murderer:</hi> And the ſame cauſe, that moved Satan to tempt the firſt man to deſtroy himſelf and his Poſterity, moves the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond man to deſtroy the third. Groundleſs envy! what hurt did Gods accepting of <hi>Abel</hi> do to <hi>Cain?</hi> what help againſt God, rejecting of <hi>Cain,</hi> could be brought by <hi>Abel?</hi> It ſhould have been <hi>Cains</hi> joy to have ſeen his brother <hi>accepted;</hi> it ſhould have been his ſorrow to have ſeen that <hi>himſelf</hi> deſerved a <hi>rejection.</hi> Could <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel</hi> have ſtayed Gods fire from deſcending, or ſhould he if he could, reject Gods acceptation, to content a brother? <hi>Cain</hi> was envious, becauſe God or <hi>Abel</hi> is
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:166919:86"/>not leſs good: He envied that good in his <hi>Brother,</hi> which he neglected in <hi>himſelf.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Cains</hi> envy made him bloody; and indeed (as one aptly expreſſeth it) ſuch is this fin, that if it eats not <hi>anothers,</hi> heart it will eat our <hi>own.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>third way</hi> of <hi>Cain,</hi> was manifeſted in the <hi>complain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his Curſe:

A Scripture, the Explication whereof, I have the more willingly toucht upon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſo clear a Comment upon the preſent Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                  <p>It hath been obſerved by ſome (as I have noted upon the eighth verſe, in the foregoing Part) That the cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of <hi>no</hi> ſinners ordinarily <hi>ariſeth ſo ſuddenly,</hi> una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably, and certainly, as that of the Seditious. We rarely, if at all, meet with any in Scripture who oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Authority, but have been puniſhed eminently in this life (to the obſervation of others:) and ſcarce do we read of any Seditious perſon, who was not taken away by a <hi>violent</hi> death; witneſs the Examples of <hi>Corah</hi> and his complices, <hi>Abſalom, Shebah, Joah, Adonijah, Zim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri, Baaſha, Athaliah.</hi> And its obſervable, that of theſe Seducers, <hi>Jude</hi> here ſaith, that they <hi>periſh'd,</hi> to note the <hi>ſpeedineſs,</hi> certainty, and irrecoverableneſs of their deſtruction.

<pb n="275" facs="tcp:166919:143"/>to be waſht off by Eccleſiaſticall Diſcipline, from the faces of holy Aſſemblies at the Lords Supper, becauſe they pollute it. True it is, that, firſt, there are two ſorts of pollution of the Lords Supper, the one that which makes the Sacrament no Sacrament, but a common or unhallowed thing, to thoſe that do receive it, as if it were given by thoſe who are no Miniſters, or to thoſe who are no Church, or without the bleſſing and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Bread; the other ſort of pollution of the Sacrament is, that which makes the adminiſtration thereof to be ſinful, and thoſe who adminiſter it to be guilty, they doing that which is contrary to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed wil of God. This latter kind of pollution, is by admitting ſpotted and ſcandalous ſinners. 2. Its granted, that the mixture of the ſcandalous, pollutes not the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, to thoſe who have uſed all the lawful means a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, who have (being Officers) diſcharged their duty by exerciſing Church Diſcipline, and being pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Chriſtians, admoniſhed the offenders, and petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned thoſe, who have the authority for the reſtraining of them from the Sacrament: in that caſe, though the ſcandalous partake of the Sacrament,

                  <p n="2">2. It argued the ſin of unuſefulneſſe and unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tableneſſe; they could not give what they had not; they had no worth, and they did no work.

                  <p>Its a great ſin to be confutations of our Profeſſions.

                  <p>Two things I ſhall here touch, by way of Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt, their being carried about is noted in this word, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, <hi>Be not carried about with diverſe and ſtrange doctrines.</hi> If one wind comes, the <hi>cloud</hi> is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried this way; if another, that way; ſomtimes to one quarter of the Heavens; at other times to a quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: ſo was it with theſe unſettled ſouls, who wanting the ballaſt and ſolidity of grace in their heart, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable, unconfirmed in their opinions, affections and practices. For the Apoſtle may hereby intend a <hi>three</hi>-fold inſtability and unſetledneſſe, or their being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried about in three reſpects.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In reſpect (principally I conceive) of <hi>opinion and judgment;</hi> they were not ſetled in the truths of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; like thoſe 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.21. who <hi>halted between
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:166919:158"/>two opinions.</hi> They <hi>continued not in the faith, grounded and ſetled,</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks <hi>Col.</hi> 1.23.) they were not placed upon a firm foundation, nor were they ſeated as a man in a ſeat, from which he cannot eaſily be removed; and 'tis frequently obſerved; that the erroneous are never firm either to the truth or their own opinions. They forget what they have been, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterſtand not what they are, and know not what they ſhall be. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> tels us how frequently <hi>Pelagius</hi> altered his opinions concerning Grace, and <hi>Hilary</hi> reports of <hi>Arius,</hi> that he had <hi>menſtruam fidem,</hi> for every month a ſundry faith, as if he had ſwallowed Moons, that he was never conſiſtent to, and with himſelf. before the Councel, he held for the Divinity of Chriſt; among his companions, otherwiſe. Thus the Apoſtle complains of the <hi>Galatians, for their being ſo ſoon removed unto another Goſpel,</hi> 1 <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. and warnes his <hi>Epheſians</hi> chap. 4.14. that they ſhould <hi>not be carried about, &amp;c.</hi> and <hi>Peter</hi> (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.14.) mentions <hi>unſtable ſouls.</hi> Oft from <hi>Browniſm</hi> men wander to <hi>Anabaptiſm,</hi> from thence to <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> thence to <hi>Socinianiſme</hi> and <hi>Arminianiſme,</hi> and then they become <hi>Seekers;</hi> or rather indeed, looſers of themſelves, juſt nothing, as a thin <hi>empty, cloud,</hi> they are toſſed ſo long up and down by winds, that at length they come to nothing at all. Their heads are like Inns, and their opinions like Travellers, which oft lodg not above one night in them; like wax, they take any new impreſſion. Its bard to ſay whether, they are pluraliſts or neutraliſts in Religion, and as hard to pleaſe them in any opinion, as to make a Coat that ſhould conſtantly fit the Moon. They know they ſhall dy, but in what faith they know not. One error is ever a bridg to another. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.16. They are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>unlearned and unſtable,</hi> and (therefore) <hi>ſuch as wreſt the Scriptures;</hi> whence its plain, that by <hi>unſtable,</hi> he means ſuch as were not grounded in the Faith and Learning of the Truth. <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:166919:158"/>once held the Truth concerning the Reſurrection, <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward erred concerniag the Faith, ſaying, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection was paſt already,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.18.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They might be <hi>carried about,</hi> and unſtable in <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of their affections,</hi> the goodneſſe whereof was one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by fits and pangs, ſometimes they were fire-hot (perhaps) in Religion; ſoon after, ſtone-cold: their heat, like that in the fit of an ague, is not from <hi>nature,</hi> but <hi>diſtemper,</hi> and therefore, though violent, yet not permanent; they reſemble the Mariners,
<note place="margin">Pſal. 107.26.</note> of whom the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, that at one time they are <hi>mounted up to heaven,</hi> and preſently, <hi>fall down again into the depths;</hi> like <hi>David,</hi> who in his youth was full of Spirits and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor, but in his old age grew cold and chilly; theſe who ſomtime ſeem'd <hi>fervent in ſpirit,</hi>

They were (they ſay) forward and fooliſh in the heat of their youth, to oppoſe ſin, but now they ſee their error, and admire their preſent ſtaiedneſſe, and the golden mean which they have attained. Thus it was with thoſe unſettled <hi>Galatians,</hi> who at firſt could have <hi>pull'd out their eyes for Paul,</hi>

<pb n="306" facs="tcp:166919:159"/>worſe then heathens, in fury againſt the truth.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They might be <hi>carried about</hi> and unſtable in their <hi>practices:</hi> very ſtrict and preciſe in their carriage at the firſt: very looſe and profane afterwards: Seducers grew from better to <hi>worſe,</hi> or (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,) <hi>worſe and worſe;
<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.13.</note> golden</hi> profeſſors haply in their youth, <hi>ſilver</hi> in their middle age, <hi>leaden</hi> in their old age.

How frequently hath the glorious, the morning beginnings of Chriſtian Profeſſion been over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt with the darkneſſe and gloomy cloudineſſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe, before the evening!

Its uſed by the Evangeliſts in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing the tempeſt miraculouſly appeaſed and calmed by Chriſt. There were ſeveral ſorts of winds and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſts wherewith theſe Seducers were <hi>carried about.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>wind of ſtrange doctrines;</hi> this is noted by the Apoſtle, <hi>Hebr.</hi> 13.9. where he warns the Chriſtians that they be not <hi>carried about with divers and ſtrange
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:166919:159"/>doctrines.</hi> And <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.14. <hi>with every wind of doctrine:</hi> Every doctrine which was new, was by them entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as true. <hi>They had itching ears,</hi> delighted with no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, not obedient ears attentive to profitable truths; whence it was that every new doctrine carried them a ſeveral way, and that they meeting with ſeveral new Doctrines, were hurried round as in a whirlwind, and knew not where to reſt. The Divel pleaſed them (like children) with change of toyes. The <hi>true</hi> Goſpel was neglected for <hi>another,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.6. they were of the ſame mind with him who taught them laſt; they were meer moveables in the Church; like the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ever of the ſame figure with the veſſel into which its put; like a company of cyphers, which ſignifie what it pleaſeth the Figure which is put before them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Seducers are carried about with the wind of fear;</hi> to ſave their skins, they car'd not what they held, taught, did; they were impatient of perſecution. Thus ſpeaks the Apoſtle of theſe <hi>ſeducers,</hi> Gal. 6.12. <hi>They conſtrain you to be circumciſed, leſt they ſhould ſuffer per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution for the croſs of Chriſt.</hi> That which they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained meerly for <hi>fear,</hi> they preſent to others as a doctrine of <hi>Faith.</hi> Theſe are reeds that bow and hang, according to the ſtanding of the winds; ſuch a <hi>reed ſhaken with the winds,</hi> was not <hi>John Baptiſt,</hi> but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther an Oak, which will ſooner be broken, then bend by the winds, by an holy Antiperiſtaſis, his zeal was doubled by oppoſition. Theſe falſe Teachers were like a man that goes to Sea for pleaſure, not for Traffick; if a ſtorm ariſe, he will come back, or put to the next ſhore: Like that ſhip, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.15. they bear not up into the wind,
<note place="margin">Jer. 9 3.</note> they <hi>are not va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant for the truth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 1.9.</note> nor hold they <hi>faſt the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Word,</hi> but let it go, if enemies contend to pull it away.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. They were <hi>carried about with the wind of pride and ambition.</hi> They gaped after the breath of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe;
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:166919:160"/>old truths are of no reputation among the giddy ſort; hence it was, that theſe were carried to teach that whereby they might be voiced, and cryed up for ſome rare men, dropt out of the clouds, and ſeeing fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then all the reſt of their times. They could not tell how to get above others, unleſs they taught ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing different from others; truth was counted but a dull, ſtale buſineſs; and therefore they choſe rather to be accounted ſuch as excelled by being erroneous, then ſuch as were onely equall to others,
<note place="margin">Vento ſuperbiae omnes haereſes animantur.</note> by delivering the truth. The wind of Pride is the life and ſoul of Error, it is the element wherein it moves and breaths; Seducers were <hi>puft up</hi> (as <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.18.) <hi>vainly by their fleſhly minds;</hi> a humble ſoul will not eaſily either teach, or follow an Error; It hath ever been the property of Seducers, to follow the peoples humour with Errors, that ſo the people might follow them with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>They were carried about with the wind of earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mindedneſs.</hi> They taught any falſe doctrine <hi>for filthy lucres ſake;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Pet. 2.</note> they would rarely be carried with any wind, but ſuch as blew them ſome profit; they ſteered their courſe by the compaſs of gain; their Religion began at their purſe ſtrings: <hi>They ſerved not the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, but their own bellies, Rom.</hi> 16.18. This was that <hi>wind</hi> which carried <hi>Balaam</hi> about from country to country, from Altar to Altar; he and his followers loved to be of the Kings Religion: Thus <hi>Eraſmus</hi> ſaid, that one poor <hi>Luther,</hi> made a great many rich Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bots and Biſhops; he meant, that by preaching againſt him, they were wont to get their great livings and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferments; <hi>Demas</hi> forſook truth, to <hi>embrace the preſent world.</hi>

1 Oppoſeth not Natural, but <hi>Spiritual life.</hi> The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of the ſoul from the body, is but the ſhadow of death: True death ſtands in the ſeparation between God and the ſoul. <hi>Where viſion faileth, people periſh,</hi> Prov. 29.18. <hi>My people periſh for want of knowledge, Hoſ.</hi> 4 6. <hi>Salvation</hi> and <hi>Life eternal</hi> ſtand in <hi>Knowledg, Joh.</hi> 17.3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Bodily famine takes away our <hi>natural ſtrength and vigor,</hi> whereby we perform our ordinary and worldly actions; but a ſoul-Famine deſtroyes that <hi>Spiritual ſtrength,</hi> whereby we are enabled to heavenly Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, Praying, Repenting, Believing, Holy-walking.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 Bodily Famine makes the outward man look pale, deformed, lean, unpleaſing; ſoul-famine brings a <hi>lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs into the ſoul,</hi> deformity and profananeſs into the face of our converſation.

                  <p n="5">5. Bodily Famine may be recompenſed and made up with Spiritual food. <hi>Iſai.</hi> 30.20. <hi>Though the Lord give the bread of Adverſity,</hi> yet he countervailes that loſs, by giving them to <hi>ſee their Teachers,</hi> whereas Spiritual fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine cannot be recompenſed by having bodily food, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe when God takes away the food of the ſoul, he takes away himſelf, the tokens of his preſence and Grace: and what can be given in exchange for God himſelf?</p>
                  <p n="6">6 Of bodily Famine people are ſenſible, they cry out thereof, and labour for a ſupply; but the more ſoul famine rageth, the more people diſregard, their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, and ſlight their wretchedneſs; by faſting, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting,

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:166919:168"/>God: <hi>It pollutes and prophanes</hi> His Name. What grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter prophanation thereof imaginable, than to put it upon an unholy, helliſh heart: Is it not more inſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, then to cloath a ſwine with the Robes of a Prince, and to put the Crown and Scepter of a King upon the head, and into the hand of a dunghil-raker?

At the beſt they ſet up, their ſtaff before they are gone half way, and are made like the people, who ſeeing the body of <hi>Amaſa</hi> lye dead by the way ſide, ſtood ſtil. In ſhort, what are theſe bare pretenders to holineſſe, but deluders of others, gins, and pitfalls in Religion, dunghils covered over with ſnow, reeds that run into the arms of thoſe who lean upon them, and ſuch who do not onely by their faithleſſeneſs (oft) deceive and gull thoſe who truſt them with their eſtates and worldly concernments, but alſo much more dangerouſly miſguide and delude the ſouls of thoſe who follow their empty doctrines, and crooked lives?</p>
                  <p>But 3. The greatneſſe of this ſin appears, principally by conſidering <hi>them who ve in it.</hi> For 1. All their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:166919:169"/>appearances are purely unprofitable unto them. Thereport of a mans being wealthy, adds nothing to his eſtate, or that of full feeding to one who is hunger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtarved. God tells the hyocritical <hi>Jews,</hi> that they <hi>truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in lying words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 7.8.</note> when they onely truſted to their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide ſhews, <hi>I will declare thy righteouſneſſe, and thy works</hi> (ſaid God to that falſe-hearted people) <hi>and they ſhall not profit thee, Iſa.</hi> 57.12. 2. Shews, without reality of holineſſe, are very hurtfull. 1. Appearing goodneſſe <hi>makes men furtheſt from</hi> being and becoming really good. Religion is a very ſerious, reall buſineſſe; yea, its very reality, and call'd in Scripture, <hi>Truth</hi> it ſelf: As the priviledges, ſo the practices of godlineſſe are indeed and in Truth, and by nothing ſo much oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as ſhadows and falſneſſe. 2. They who pleaſe themſelves with appearances <hi>will never labour for the reality</hi> of holineſſe, nor <hi>truth in the inward parts;</hi> they are ſeldome reproved by others, nor is it ſo eaſie to faſten a reproof upon them, as upon thoſe who are void of all ſhews of Religion; and ſo they go on in a miſerable quietneſſe, and uninterruptedneſſe to their own deſtruction. 3. They who barely appear holy, are of all others the moſt impudent, not bluſhing to be accounted ſuch as their own conſciences tell them they are far from being. <hi>Naomi</hi> was aſhamed of her ſelf, when the men of <hi>Bethlehem</hi> ſaid, <hi>Is not this Naomi? Cal me not</hi> (ſaid ſhe) <hi>Naomi, call me Marah, for the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hath dealt very bitterly with me. Ruth.</hi> 1.20. But theſe ſay, cal us Chriſtians, though they are no better than heathens; call us Saints, though they are inwardly but rotten Sepulchers: Account us to be in the higheſt form of Religion, though they have not (as yet) ſtept over the threſhold of Religon's School. Eſteem us to be ful, although we be altogether empty. True ſaints are aſham'd of commendation, though they be full of worth: hypocrites glory in being commended, though they have nothing in them commendable. When men
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:166919:169"/>have not the thing, its moſt <hi>unreaſonable that they ſhould have the name.</hi> When God gave <hi>Abram</hi> the name of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he told him there was a reaſon why he ſhould be called by that name,
<note place="margin">Gen. 17.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Thy Name ſhall be called Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bam, for a father of many Nations, have I made thee. Abigail</hi> ſaid concerning her Husband, As his name is, ſo is he, <hi>Nabal is his name, and folly is with him;</hi> and if Chriſtians be our name, true Chriſtianity ſhould be with us. Laſtly, ſuch <hi>clouds without water,</hi> appearing Profeſſors, render themſelves, of all others, <hi>moſt inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable.</hi> If Religion were <hi>bad,</hi> why did they ſo much as profeſs it; if <hi>good,</hi> why did they not more, even love it alſo? If they took upon themſelves, the title and trade of Gods ſervants, why would they not do his work? If God be a <hi>maſter, where is his fear; if a father, where is his honour?</hi> If they would not <hi>be</hi> his ſervants, why would they be <hi>called</hi> ſo? If they would be <hi>called</hi> his ſervants, why would they not be ſo? how fearful ſhould we then be, of putting our ſouls off, with ſhadows of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! Labour for that truth in the <hi>inward parts,</hi> which all the expreſſions of the <hi>outward man</hi> are not able to reach; and remember that hereafter, all paint muſt fall off, which was not laid in the oyle of ſincerity; and Hypocrites ſhall be diſcovered and unmasked both to their own conſciences, and the judgments of all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, reſpects not (here) that time of the year which we call <hi>Autumn,</hi> but only the nature of the <hi>fruit,</hi> which theſe trees brought forth; namely, ſuch as are <hi>withered,</hi> and altogether <hi>unprofitable,</hi> as if theſe trees were called, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>More particularly, two things are here further to be opened.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>What that fruit was, which theſe Seducers might have;</hi> and what kind of fruits theſe Trees might bear.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 <hi>What was the withering of that fruit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. For the <hi>Firſt.</hi> That fruit which they might bear.</p>
                  <p>There are three ſorts of Metaphorical fruits, mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Scripture, which men compared to trees, are ſaid to yeild.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>fruits of the Sanctifying Spirit of God</hi> (Graces and Works) brought forth in the hearts and lives of the Saints; called fruits, becauſe they come from the Spirit of God, as fruit from the tree, and are as pleaſing to him as the pleaſanteſt fruit is to us. Thus we read of the <hi>fruits of the Spirit,</hi> Gal. 5.22. and <hi>Fruits of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,</hi> Phil. 1.11. <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance,</hi> Matth. 3.8. All comprehended by <hi>Paul, Epheſ.</hi> 5.9. where he ſaith, <hi>The fruit of the Spirit is in all Goodneſs, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Truth. Goodneſs,</hi> being that quality, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to Malice or naughtineſs, whereby a ſinner is evil in himſelf, <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> oppoſed to Injuſtice, whereby one is hurtful and injurious to others. <hi>Truth</hi> oppoſed to Errors, Hereſies, Hypocriſie, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3 There are <hi>fruits</hi> which in themſelves and their own nature, are <hi>bitter, corrupt, poyſonful,</hi> put forth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:166919:173"/>by a corrupt tree, but by it, as ſuch, evil <hi>propter fieri</hi> in themſelves and their own nature; ſuch fruits by which the falſe Prophets were known, and whereby men may be known to be wicked men, <hi>Grapes of Gall and bitter cluſters,</hi> Deut. 32.32. Such <hi>works of the fleſh</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> mentions, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Adultery, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, Laeſciviouſneſs, Idolatry, Witcheraft, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 There are other fruits which are not evil in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelvs, unlawful or intrinſecally evil in their own ſubſtance and nature, <hi>propter eſſe</hi> and <hi>fieri,</hi> becauſe they are, or are done: but becauſe they <hi>grow upon ſuch trees,</hi> by reaſon whereof, ſomething which ſhould make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them good, is omitted, and ſundry deffects cleave unto them, and they have evil caſt upon them by the <hi>agent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſundry fruits of this ſort and rank there may be upon ſuch trees as <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks of. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1 The Fruits of <hi>gifts, parts,</hi> and <hi>abilities</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, as preaching, praying, utterance; of theſe ſpeaks Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.22. <hi>Many ſhall ſay in that day, Lord, have we not Propheſied &amp;c.</hi> And 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.1. they are called <hi>Spiritual Gifts,</hi> wrought by the Spirit; but are not <hi>Sanctificantia,</hi> but <hi>Miniſtrantia;</hi> not ſo ſanctifying him <hi>in</hi> whom; but helping thoſe <hi>for</hi> whom they are; as a rich man may beſtow good and dainty dyet upon a poor woman that nurſeth his child, not for her own ſake, but that his child may ſuck good milk from her; ſuch fruits as theſe (indeed) may beautifie <hi>Grace,</hi> but yet Grace muſt ſanctifie <hi>them.</hi> Theſe may make us profitable to <hi>men,</hi> not acceptable to <hi>God:</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2 The <hi>ſecond</hi> ſort of theſe fruits, which theſe trees might bear, is a <hi>temporary faith,</hi> O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>thodox, or ſound judgment, aſſent to that which is the very Truth of Gods Word; that <hi>there is a God,</hi> infinite in all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Perfections; that there are three Perſons; that
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:166919:174"/>Chriſt was God and man &amp;c. and that all who believe in him ſhall be ſaved. Thus ſome unconverted are ſaid to <hi>beleeve</hi> for a while, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.13. thus <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> believed; theſe fruits are good in their kind, and without them there can be no holineſſe of life, nor hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe after death, and yet they are not good enough, they not purifying the heart, but only perfecting the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; they being poured only on the head, not running down like <hi>Aarons</hi> oyntment to the heart and other parts: though making a man <hi>Proteſtant</hi> in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, yet leaving him to be a <hi>recuſant</hi> in his life, carrying him out to believe the word as <hi>faithful,</hi> but not to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it as <hi>worthy of all acceptation,</hi> to ſhine with light, but not to burn with, or work by love.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. A third ſort of theſe fruits might be ſome <hi>heated affections,</hi> ſweet motions, <hi>receiving the word with joy.</hi> a finding ſome ſweetneſſe in the ordinances:
<note place="margin">Matth. 13.20, John 5.35. Matth. 27.3. 1 Kings 21. Ezek. 33.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Ezekiel</hi> was to his hearers, as a <hi>lovely ſong of one that hath a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant voice.</hi> They who ſhall be caſt into utter darkneſſe, may for a ſeaſon <hi>rejoyce in the light,</hi> and may have ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and grief about ſin. The <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were oft deep in their humiliations;
<note place="margin">Pſal. 78.4 7.</note> they <hi>ſought God and returned, enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red early after God: Ahab humbled himſelf.</hi> And yet theſe fruits are not the beſt, they may ſpring up from a root not good; the pleaſantneſſe or ſadneſſe of the matter of any doctrine, may cauſe ſutable affections of joy or ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; the novelty or rarity of a doctrine, may much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; or the dexterity and ability of the deliverer, the ſutableneſſs of a clearly diſcovered truth to a hearers un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding; the apprehenſion of the goodneſſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things, may ſtir up ſome flaſhing deſires; thus they cried out, <hi>Lord, give us ever more this bread;</hi> thus <hi>Balaam</hi> deſires to <hi>die the death of the righteous,</hi> yea (as ſome have obſerved) corrupt luſts in men, ſuch as <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeking,</hi> may produce great affections in holy duties: The deſire of applauſe may make men in publick adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions enlarged in their affections. The more excellent a
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:166919:174"/>Prayer or Sermon is, the more carnal the heart of the performer may be; the ſtronger the invention is, the weaker the grace may be; and as ground full of mines of Gold, is oft barren of graſſe, ſo a heart ful of grace may, it may be barren of the ornaments of words and expreſſions.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. A <hi>fourth</hi> ſort of fruits born even by theſe (after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward) apoſtates, might be external appearances of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Law of God, in avoiding of all open and ſcandalous courſes, and in performing the viſible and outſide acts of obedience: Thus the Phariſee was not an <hi>Extortioner, unjuſt, an Adulterer. Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth, 18.11. Phil. 3.</note> touching the law, was <hi>blameleſs:</hi> the young man profeſſed he had <hi>kept the Law</hi> (in the letter of it) <hi>from his youth.</hi> The Phariſees paid Tithes exactly, abhorred idolatry, made long prayers and frequent, were ſtrict in the outward obſervation of the Sabboth, profeſſed chaſtity, tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance &amp;c. Thus it's ſaid of theſe very Apoſtates, that they had <hi>eſcap'd the pollutions of the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. and 22. that they had been <hi>waſhed:</hi> And theſe fruits of outward conformity to the Law of God, are highly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable; ſincerity of grace can neither be, nor be known without them: by them it reſolves (as <hi>Elijah</hi> ſaid) to <hi>ſhew</hi> it ſelf; they are commanded by God,
<note place="margin">1 King. 18.15.</note> who (though he commands not the godly to fulfill the Law <hi>perfectly,</hi> yet) permits them not to break it <hi>wilful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly:</hi> and though by the preſence of external obedience, we cannot conclude <hi>ſalvation,</hi> yet by the abſence thereof we may conclude <hi>damnation</hi> to follow; theſe honour God, benefit others. Though our righteouſneſſe ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies not <hi>juſtice,</hi> yet in our unrighteouſneſſe we cannot be ſaved without injuſtice; nor is any man called a good man for the good which he <hi>hath,</hi> but the good which he <hi>doth:</hi> outward obedience ſtrengthens true grace where it is, and is neceſſary to preſerve a juſtified eſtate, though not as deſerving it, yet as removing that which would deſtroy it. And yet all theſe fruits, the acts of
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:166919:175"/>externall obedience, are not the beſt; they may be a ſhape without a ſoul: appearances without an inward principle of life, they might be with a deſpiſing of the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt; they might be performed only for want of tentations to the contrary: Gods glory might never be aim'd at, in the performing them, as their <hi>end,</hi> nor his Word eyed as their <hi>Rule.</hi> Theſe things commanded by <hi>God,</hi> might be done in obedience to <hi>luſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Spiritual,</hi> befalling either the <hi>godly,</hi> or the <hi>wicked.</hi> 1. The godly are ſaid to be dead <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> three wayes. 1. <hi>Dead to ſin, Rom.</hi> 6.2. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. the corruption of their natures being by the Spirit of Chriſt ſubdued and deſtroyed. 2. Dead in reſpect of the <hi>Law Ceremonial, Col.</hi> 2.20. <hi>(dead with Chriſt from the rudiments of the world.) Moral, Gal.</hi> 2.19. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he <hi>was dead to the Law,</hi> and <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>Ye are dead to the Law,</hi> it being not able to make them guilty who are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> nor to <hi>terrifie</hi> their conſciences, nor to <hi>irritate</hi> them to ſin. 3. <hi>Dead to the world,</hi> Gal. 6.4. ſo <hi>Paul was crucified to the world,</hi> either becauſe the World contemned and deſpiſed him as a dead man; or elſe, becauſe the world had no more power, to entice and allure him from Chriſt, then the objects of the ſenſes have to work upon a dead man. 2. Spiritual death befalls the wicked and unregenerate, they being without the Spirit of Chriſt to animate and quicken them, which Spirit enlivens the ſoul ſupernaturally, as the ſoul doth the body natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; hence they are ſaid to be <hi>dead in ſins,</hi> Eph. 2.1.5. Col. 2.13. and <hi>dead, Mat.</hi> 8.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 9.60. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25. and <hi>to remain in death.</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. Their works (hence) are ſaid to be <hi>dead, Hebr.</hi> 9.14. As the immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality of the damned, is no life, but an eternall death; ſo the conjunction of the ſouls and bodies of wicked men, is not properly life, but <hi>umbratilis vita,</hi> a ſhadow of life, or rather a very death, they being without ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual feeding, growth, working, all vital operations, and
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:166919:178"/>lying under the deformity, loathſomneſs, inſenſibleneſs, (in a ſpiritual ſenſe) of ſuch as are dead; or (according to the reſemblance here uſed by our Apoſtle, which is, that of trees dead) they are ſpiritually dead, becauſe without, and ſevered from that root of every good tree, the Lord Chriſt. The old <hi>Adam</hi> is the root upon which they ſtill ſtand, and therefore they are without all ſpiritual and ſupernatural life; as from the root flows life into all the branches of the tree, ſo from Chriſt, all who are united to him by the Spirit through Faith, have (by thoſe means) the life of holineſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived unto them; as in <hi>Adam,</hi> the firſt root who hath now loſt the moiſture and vigour of holineſs, and is become a dryed root, <hi>all die;</hi> ſo in <hi>Chriſt ſhall all</hi> (and onely) they who are really united to him <hi>live.</hi> Hence it is, that as they are without the root, and therefore with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>life,</hi> ſo without all ſpiritual growth and fruitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; the inward principle of life being wanting, needs muſt the effects that flow from that principle (all vitall operations) be wanting likewiſe; for though <hi>abiding,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 15.5.</note> and living by Chriſt, we bring forth <hi>much fruit;</hi> yet <hi>ſever'd from him, we can do nothing.</hi> It is true, that as the wicked have ſomething from Chriſt like the <hi>Spirit of life,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.4. 1 Cor. 12.6, 7.</note> ſo thereby they bring forth ſomething <hi>like to good</hi> and ſpiritual fruits; I mean, thoſe forementi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned fruits of gifts, aſſent to the truth, ſweet affections, acts of external obedience: but though in the producing of theſe, the Spirit helps them, yet it never changeth the <hi>nature</hi> of the trees, but they ſtill retain the natural ſowrneſs of their roots; and though God gives them the Spirit to edifie others, yet not to ſanctifie themſelves; though <hi>Saul</hi> had <hi>another ſpirit;</hi> and ſundry (<hi>Matth.</hi> 7.) did <hi>prophecy,</hi> and <hi>caſt out Divels;</hi> yet all theſe were but works of <hi>miniſtration,</hi> not <hi>renovation;</hi> though the Spirit works as an outward efficient cauſe, breathing on them; and is in them as <hi>in Organis,</hi> Inſtruments, and Miniſters, yet not as <hi>in domiciliis,</hi> as in habitations &amp; Members; for as
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:166919:179"/>the ſoul works not as a <hi>form</hi> to any part, that is not united to the body; ſo neither doth the <hi>Spirit</hi> of Chriſt work ſavingly, but in the <hi>body</hi> of Chriſt. In the wicked it may be <hi>ſpiritus movens,</hi> a <hi>moving</hi> ſpirit: in the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, tis onely <hi>ſpiritus inhabitans,</hi> an <hi>inhabiting, indwell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Spirit. The Spirit of God in an Hypocrire, is like an Angel appearing in ſome outward ſhape; of which he is only an <hi>aſſiſting,</hi> not an <hi>informing</hi> form; for which cauſe, his aſſumed body hath neither life, nor nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but the Spirit of God in the godly, is like the ſoul in the body, not only aſſiſting, but informing, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in them ſpiritually vitall, and ſupernatural opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And notwithſtanding the beſt workings of the Spirit of God in <hi>the wicked,</hi> they are oft left, more fleſhly, ſelf-confident, leſs poor in Spirit, and ſenſible of their want of Chriſt then before. And thus theſe Seducers were <hi>ſpiritually dead.</hi> Or 3. Death is <hi>eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> the effect of the former: which eternal death is that moſt miſerable condition of the Reprobate after death; wherein they are deprived of all the bleſſedneſs and glory of heaven, ſtanding in the enjoyment and <hi>unitive viſion</hi> of God;

                  <p>Trees then, are ſaid to be <hi>twice dead,</hi> thus; the <hi>firſt</hi> time, a tree is ſaid be dead, when in the former ſpring it decayes, fades, withers in its leaves, bloſſoms, or newly formed fruit: from this decaying or dying (for a dying it is, as to <hi>leaves and fruit</hi>) a tree is oft by pruning &amp; dreſſing <hi>recovered;</hi> but if in <hi>autumn</hi> or the later ſpring, which is the critical or climacterial time of Trees to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover

In like manner, theſe ſeducers of whom <hi>Jude</hi> ſpeaks, had a double death, or were <hi>twice dead,</hi> firſt they were dead in reſpect of their natural condition, by being (as are others) <hi>born in ſin,</hi> and ſo (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.1) <hi>dead in ſin;</hi> from this they were ſo far recovered, as that they ſeem'd to live and (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20.) to have <hi>eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped</hi> the pollutions, of the world; and by viſible profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to flouriſh, and to give fair hopes of bearing good fruit: notwithſtanding this firſt death, they were not given over as irrecoverable, but their later death which was by Apoſtacy from the faith of Chriſt, by reintang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling themſelves in <hi>the pollutions of the world, and returning to their vomit and wallowing in the mire,</hi> brought them into ſuch a hopeleſſe deplorable condition, that our A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle no more expected their recovery, then the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of a tree dead <hi>twice,</hi> or the <hi>ſecond time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Indeed there is an Apoſtacy <hi>of impotency of affection, and prevalency of luſt,</hi> a recidivation or relapſe into a former ſinfull condition, out of forgetfulneſſe and falſeneſſe of heart, for want of the fear of God, to ballance the conſcience, and to fix and unite the heart to him.

Oh, how ſhould Chriſtians labour to diſappoint and countermine this the Divels moſt deſtructive policie!

                  <p>And that our Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>theſe</hi> ſtars, as it is the opinion of <hi>Junius, Perkins, Diodat,</hi> and alſo of ſundry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> as <hi>Cajetan, Lapide, Lorinus;</hi> ſo ſeems it very probable, conſidering that tho the 7 planets have various &amp; different motions in their orbs, yet their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are ſo regular and conſtant, that they are certainly known even before they have fulfilled them, and alſo give clear direction to a man concerning times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and the parts of the heavens and earth; and therefore it ſeems not probable, that the Apoſtle would call theſe ſeducers <hi>wandring ſtars,</hi> or (as the <hi>Syriack</hi>) <hi>ſeductrices,</hi> or (as the <hi>Arabick</hi>) <hi>caliginoſas,</hi> by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring them to the ſeven planets: And beſides, as the <hi>puniſhments</hi> contained in the former meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors of <hi>trees, clouds, waves,</hi> are the continuations of the three foreſaid reſemblances, ſo the puniſhment which the Apoſtle ſubjoynes, <hi>[blackneſs of darkneſſe]</hi> ſeems a continuation of the metaphor of <hi>wandring ſtars</hi> &amp; is ſuch as agrees not to the ſeven planets, but to theſe meteors or tranſitory impreſſions or exhalations, which though for a time they flame and blaze brightly, yet quickly go out and end in ſoot, ſmoak, and black dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Why doth our Apoſtle here call theſe ſeducers ſtars,</hi> and <hi>wandring</hi> ſtars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By giving them this title of <hi>ſtars,</hi> I conceive our Apoſtle intends either firſt to ſhew their <hi>duty,</hi> which was as Chriſtians, eſpecially as teachers of others, <hi>to ſhine like ſtars</hi> before others, both by their doctrine and life, and by both to be holily influential upon them:
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:166919:210"/>or 2. (rather) the Apoſtle by calling them <hi>ſtars,</hi> would inſinuate what they <hi>deſired to be eſteemed</hi> and accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted among the people, namely the eminent and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lights of the Church, ſuch as were fixed in heaven in reſpect of their meditations and affections, ſuch as directed others in the way to heaven, afforded ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al heat and life and quickning to them; whereas indeed, they were but falſe lights, <hi>wandring ſtars,</hi> ſuch as led or rather miſ-led people into the waies of error and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. And both theſe reaſons of the Apoſtles cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling theſe ſeducers <hi>ſtars,</hi> are made more then probable by that frequently uſed and elegant compariſon of ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, wherein the Miniſters of the Church are ſet forth by <hi>ſtars.

In regard 1. of their <hi>nature:</hi> a ſtar is of the ſame nature with the heavens, celeſtial, not Elementary; Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould be <hi>pure,
<note place="margin">Job. 25.5. 1 Tim. 4.12. 2 Cor 6.6.</note> blameleſſe,</hi> inoffenſive; they ſhould teach <hi>facienda et faciendo, voce et vitâ,</hi> by lip and life, tongue and hand; their profeſſion is holy, they are compared to <hi>Angels,</hi> called <hi>holy Angels;</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were called <hi>holy Prophets:</hi> In their heart they ſhould experimentally find the work of holineſſe, and in their converſations expreſs it.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 3.5.6.7 Epheſ. 4.11.</note> 2. It is the nature of a ſtar to be receptive of <hi>light,</hi> and that from the Sun; Miniſters ſhould abound in the light of knowledg. They are called <hi>lights;</hi> their <hi>lips ſhould preſerve know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>apt to teach:</hi> and as the ſtars beams are borrowed from the ſun; the calling, gifts, abilities of the Miniſter are from Chriſt; he hath <hi>ſet them in his Church,</hi> he is with them, without him <hi>they can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> he gives them work, ſtrength, ſucceſſe, wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Stars</hi> in reſpect of their <hi>ſituation and poſition,</hi> they are high placed above the earth; and thus Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:166919:210"/>ſhould be ſtars advanced above others, as in reſpect of their calling, which of all others is the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and honourable, and of their gifts of wiſdome &amp;c. ſo of that high regard, and reverend eſteeme, <hi>double honour</hi> which the faithfull ſhould beſtow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. As they have the higheſt place in the Church, ſo walking worthy of their place, they ſhould have the higheſt place in the hearts of beleevers; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they ſhould be high and heavenly in their aimes, affections, Converſations: they ſhould carry themſelves as the Prophets and Miniſters of the moſt high; they ſhould not undertake their high and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious function for low and baſe ends, for honour, wealth, Eaſe, but for the advancing of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> the bringing of ſoules to heaven. <hi>Their affections muſt not be ſet upon theſe things which are below:</hi> mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and poſſeſſions ſhould lye at their feet, not their heart. An earthly minded miniſter reſembles a clod, not a ſtar; their <hi>Converſation</hi> ſhould be <hi>in heaven.</hi> A Star would give no light, if it were not in heaven. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is made profitable to the people by the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly carriage of the miniſter: Stars are of a round ſphericall figure, and an orb or boul toucheth the earth not as a plane, but only <hi>in puncto.</hi> A little earth ſhould ſeem enough to a miniſter, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. And as the greateſt ſtars, in regard of their diſtance from the earth appear but ſmall, ſo thoſe miniſters who in gifts, and graces are moſt Eminent,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 4.9.13.</note> are yet in the opinions of men, ſmall, vile, Contemptible, the <hi>off-ſcouring</hi> of the world, and baſely eſteemed: this is their lot, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<note place="margin">Mat. 20.26.</note> it ſhould be their Care to be little in their own eſteeme, though never ſo higly advanced above others, conſidering that as Gods free love gave them their place, and glory, ſo their own pride may quickly take away both from them.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Stars in reſpect of the <hi>different degrees</hi> of their glory. <hi>One ſtar differs</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>from another
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:166919:211"/>ſtar in glory.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.41.</note> There is one glory of the Sun, another of the Moon. In Chriſt Jeſus is</hi> the fulneſſe of light and knowledge, and to his Miniſters he variouſly and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently diſpenſeth his gifts, there are <hi>difference of adminiſtrations, diverſities of gifts, diverſities of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,

Miniſters have <hi>gifts differing according to the grace that is given them.</hi> There are ſeverall notes in Muſick, yet all make up one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony; and there are ſundry and different qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in Miniſters, yet all tending to the Churches uſe and benefit. And therefore</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Stars in reſpect of their <hi>uſefulneſſe</hi> and beneficial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to the Church. Stars are not made to be uſeful to themſelves but others. Miniſters muſt not ſeek their own, but others good. Stars give direction, light, influences, &amp;c. Its a great help to mariners, when they can ſee a ſtar in a dark night. When <hi>Paul</hi> and they ſailed with him could ſee <hi>neither Sun, nor ſtar</hi> for their direction, they were without all hope of coming ſafe to Land, <hi>Act.</hi> 27.20. Many poor ſouls are caſt away for want of miniſters to direct to Chriſt: they ſhould be like that ſtar, which ſhew'd the Wiſemen where to finde Chriſt. And (as they did, ſo) people ſhould <hi>rejoyce</hi> with exceding joy when they ſee ſuch a ſtar. Miniſters (as ſtars) ſhould give light <hi>to, and be the light of the world,</hi> both in reſpect of Doctrine and Converſation. A miniſter muſt not hide his gifts &amp; put his candle under a buſhel: nor ſhould others extinguiſh theſe Lights, either by withdrawing the oyle of maintenance, or blowing them out with the wind of perſecution. Theſe ſtars muſt ſhine though dogs bark, though men ſhut their eyes, and in a night of perſecution; yea then moſt brightly. Their <hi>light</hi> ſhould <hi>ſhine</hi> that God may be <hi>glorified.</hi>

                  <p>God ſpeaks of the <hi>Pleiades and Orion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Job. 38.31.</note> which are a company of ſtars in the heavenly Orb; <hi>Canſt thou bind the ſweet influences of the Pleiades, or looſe the bands of Orion?</hi> When the <hi>Pleiades</hi> ariſe, its Spring; they open the earth, they make herbs and flowers grow, the trees to ſprout, and the plants to wax green. <hi>Orion</hi> produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth cold, the Winter comes when that ſhewes it ſelf. Good Miniſters (as the <hi>Pleiades</hi>) quicken the heart, warm and make it fruitful in holineſs. Bad Miniſters (like the ſtars of <hi>Orion</hi>) cool and dead peoples hearts to all goodneſs.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Stars in reſpect of their <hi>ſwift and Conſtant moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> they muſt be ſtars for motion, as well as for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motion: Tis true, their motion ſhould only be in their Orb and Sphere; they ſhould not ſo viſit others Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as to neglect their own; nor be Buſie-bodies in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens matters, nor intangle themſelves in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of this life, nor follow other vocations, leſt they teach thoſe of other vocations to fall into theirs; they muſt not leap out of their own element, nor forſake the employments of Prayer, Study, Preaching, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In worldly affairs, they ſhould be as fiſh out of the water; but yet in their own Orb let them move: Loytering is unſutable to a Harveſt-man; they muſt be <hi>Workmen that need not be aſhamed;</hi> its better to be worn with uſing, then ruſting. <hi>Pauls</hi> glory was not, that he Lorded it, but that he laboured more then they all: they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:166919:212"/>think their labour is ended, till their life be ended: they muſt look upon their motion and work as circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, it muſt ever return; and the end of one ſervice, is to be the beginning of another: their lives muſt be a ſucceſſion of labours, praying, ſtudying, preaching, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing; (yea (if God wil) conflicting muſt be added) like the waves of the Sea, overtaking one another: The wages will countervail for all.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Stars, in reſpect of <hi>their Duration and Continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</hi> They are ſet in a <hi>Firmament:</hi> All the powers of Hell, ſhall never utterly remove Miniſters.

<note place="margin">Jer. 31.36.</note> The <hi>Ordinances of the ſtars,</hi> are ſuch, as ſhall not <hi>depart from before God:</hi> They are <hi>eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed for ever:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 33.25.</note> God hath <hi>made a Covenant with the day and night,</hi> not to be <hi>broken:</hi> Till the end of the world, there ſhall be ſtars in the Heaven, Miniſters in the Church; Chriſt will <hi>be with them,</hi> and therefore they muſt needs be to the <hi>end of the world:</hi> Could they have been pul'd down, that work had long agoe been done. When <hi>Satan</hi> the <hi>Dragon</hi> did his utmoſt, he left two parts of three behind; and that third part which he ſwept down, were not fixt in their Orb, not faithful to their truſt, but <hi>wandring ſtars:</hi> but they who are in the <hi>right hand of Chriſt,</hi> ſhall never be pluck'd away; Chriſt will have his number alwaies. And they who will go about to pull the <hi>ſtars</hi> out of his <hi>right hand,</hi> ſhall feel the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of his right hand. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying of the Miniſtry out of the Church, is but a vain attempt; and yet, though theſe ſtars ſhall ſhine to the end of the World, they ſhall ſhine no longer. When the night of ſin and ignorance is at an end, when the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhall ariſe, and the Lord Jeſus himſelf ſhall come, there will be no more uſe of theſe ſtars. When we come to drink out of the Fountain, we ſhall no more need the Bottle: <hi>Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies ſhall fail, Tongues ſhall ceaſe, Knowledge ſhall vaniſh
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:166919:212"/>away: When that which is perfect is come,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.8, 10.</note> then that which is in part ſhall be done away.</hi> Chriſt ſhall both ſucceed, and exceed them. All the ſtars in the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, cannot make a Day; nor can all the Teachers in the world convey that light, which Chriſt will afford in Heaven. Oh how gloriouſly will our Sun ſhine, when all the (ſomtimes) glorious ſtars, ſhall be ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed up in his glory!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Apoſtle cals theſe Seducers not ſimply <hi>ſtars,</hi> but <hi>wandring ſtars:</hi> And why <hi>wandring ſtars?</hi> (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding ſuch as are ſliding, gliding, ſhootting, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſtars?)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard of the <hi>matter</hi> of theſe ſtars: They were but earthly exhalations, when they ſeemed to ſhine in all their glory; they were not of that pure Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial nature, with thoſe ſtars which they did ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble; they had Earthly, or as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of the rich Glutton, they had <hi>animas triticeas,</hi> wheaten hearts, they ſought themſelves; <hi>their belly was their God,</hi> they <hi>minded earthly things:</hi> Earth and Slime was their food and fewel: and when the earthly exhalation of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, Pleaſure, and Honour was ſpent, theſe ſtars went out: They were not like ſtars that ſhined to benefit the earth, but meerly to be fed, and by being fed by the earth. They were ſlimie, ſenſual, unclean creatures, when they were moſt ſhining; ſervants of <hi>corruption:</hi> They taught falſe Doctrines <hi>for filthy lucres ſake,</hi> and ſteered their Courſe by the Compaſs of Profit; ſo that though the world (had they been true ſtars) ſhould have been guided by them, they were guided by the world.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.

What wickedneſs greater, then for a Judge to be unjuſt, for a Phyſician to be a Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, for a Seer to be blind, for a Guide to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guide? Tis not ſo heinouſly ſinful for any, as for a <hi>Teacher</hi> of ſouls, to be a <hi>deceiver</hi> of ſouls: Who ſhall ſhew a ſoul the way to heaven, if a Miniſter (like <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lijah,</hi> who pretending to lead the blind <hi>Syrians</hi> to <hi>Dothan,</hi> guided them to <hi>Samaria,</hi> where they were in the midſt of their Enemies;) ſhall lead them the way to Hell? Who ſhould ſave life, if they who ſhould break the bread of life, give poyſon in ſtead of bread? Or if they whoſe <hi>lips ſhould feed many,</hi> only infect and poyſon many? And further, what ſeduction is ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive as ſoul-ſeduction? Is the miſery of leading mens bodies into Ditches and Quagmires by a <hi>fools fire,</hi> comparable to the woe of being led into the pit of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and the ditch of hell and damnation by an er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous Miniſter? he that is miſ-guided into hell, can never be drawn out again: here tis true, <hi>veſtigia nulla retrorſum,</hi> no coming back. The cheating a man of his money, though it be a loſs, its a recoverable one; but he thats deceived of his ſoul, guld out of his God, what hath he more to loſe, or what poſſibility hath he ever to repair his damage? There is no folly ſo great, as to be coggd and inticed out of life eternal; nor any deceit ſo cruel, as to cheat the ſoul: nothing can be light, wherewith the ſoul is hurt. Oh how deeply then is God provoked, when he delivers up a people to the miſ-guidings of Seducers! Its better ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times to have a tyrannical Prince over our bodies, then to have a treacherous Paſtour over our ſouls; and yet how do people groan and ſigh under the former,
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:166919:219"/>and how ſlightly do they regard the latter! Surely, if for the ſins of a people, their Magiſtrates are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive; for their ſins it is, that their Miniſters are er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roneous. How juſt is it with God, that they who will not be Diſciples to truth, ſhould be Proſelytes to errour! that when none will follow the ſeeing Guide, many ſhould follow the <hi>pernicious wayes</hi> of the <hi>blind Guide!</hi> The true deſerving cauſe of peoples ſeduction, is, (as the Prophet ſpeaks) <hi>The people love to have it ſo. The Prophets propheſie falſly, and the people love to have it ſo; Jer.</hi> 5.3. They will not <hi>indure ſound Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine,</hi> they will not ſuffer a <hi>Micaiah</hi> to inſtruct them, and therefore God ſends them a <hi>Zedekiah</hi> to ſeduce them. They who <hi>received not the love of the truth, had ſtrong deluſions ſent them from God,</hi> and upon them the <hi>deceivableneſs of unrighteouſneſs</hi> took hold, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10, 11. The <hi>Prophet is a fool,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Hoſea,</hi> Chap. 9.7.) <hi>The ſpiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and the great hatred.</hi> The inſtructers of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> were fooliſh, blind, and erroneous; becauſe the <hi>ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> of the people in rebelling againſt the light of truth, had ſtirred up God thus to ſhew his great <hi>hatred</hi> againſt them. God never ſends darkneſs among a people, till they ſhut their eyes againſt the light. If we will impriſon truth, God may juſtly ſet Seducers looſe. Oh labour then to follow true, if you would not be miſled by falſe lights; and to be directed by <hi>fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> if you would not be ſeduced by <hi>wandring</hi> ſtars. To conclude this needful point (then) with caution both to Miniſters and People: To the former, I offer my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble thoughts in this hearty requeſt, That they would conſider, the beſt of them have ſins enough of their own to anſwer for, without contracting more by the miſleading of others. As inexcuſable it is, for Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to lead people in a wrong way, as for people not to follow Miniſters in a right way. If then we would not miſlead any in this night of darkneſs and ſin, let
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:166919:219"/>us be ſure to be <hi>fixed</hi> ſtars our ſelves: let us neither be Planets nor Meteors, let us be fixed to our Scripture Principles, deliberately chuſing what we ſhould love, but then ſtedfaſtly loving what we have choſen.

                     <hi>Great is Gods forbearance towards ſinners. Black<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of darkneſs is reſerved</hi> for them, not preſently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon them. Frequently doth the Scripture pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim Gods <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> and his being <hi>ſlow to anger:</hi> The Apoſtle mentions his <hi>forberance</hi> and <hi>long-ſuffering, Rom.</hi> 2.4. <hi>He endured with much long-ſuffering the veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction, Rom.</hi> 9.22. He gave the old World an hundred and twenty years ſpace of repentance. He <hi>endured the manners of the Iſraelites forty years in the Wilderneſs, Acts</hi> 13.18. <hi>Four hundred years</hi> he ſpared the <hi>Canaanites, Gen.</hi> 15.16. And ſundry waies may this greatneſs of Gods <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> be amplified. 1. He forbears puniſhing ſinners, though he ſee their ſin, and be moſt <hi>ſenſible</hi> thereof; he ſees all the circumſtances of ſin, the moſt ſecret and retired wickedneſſes in the heart, all are na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, ript up, ranſackt, anatomized before him; men forbear to puniſh men, becauſe they know not the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret machinations of miſchiefe, which are againſt-them but God, though he beholds all, yet he ſpares long. 2. He doth not only behold ſin where it is, but lothes <hi>it wherever he beholds it;</hi> though he ſees it every where with an eye of <hi>obſervation,</hi> yet no where with an eye of <hi>approbation.</hi> Sin is oppoſite to his very nature; man may love ſin, and yet be ſtil a man; but if God ſhould love ſin, he ſhould ceaſe to be God: he is under ſin, as a <hi>cart preſſed with ſheaves, Amos</hi> 2.13. All the hatred that man bears to all the things in the world, which are either hateful or hurtful to him, is not comparable to Gods deteſtation of the leaſt ſin. 3. He is able to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh ſin, wherever he either looks upon it or loathes
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:166919:220"/>it. As the ſecreteſt ſinner is within the reach of his eye, ſo the ſtrongeſt ſinner is within the reach of his arm: he is as able to throw a ſinner into hel, as to tel him of hel; he in all his forbearances, loſeth not his <hi>power,</hi> but exerciſeth his <hi>patience;</hi> he can, but wil not puniſh. 4. He doth not only <hi>forbear</hi> puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but ſeeks to <hi>prevent it: He waits that he may be gracious.</hi> He is not willing that any ſhould periſh: he ſtrikes more gently for a while, that he may not ſtrike eternally; and he ſtayes and warns ſo long, that hee may not ſtrike at all. 5. He not only ſuffers ſinners <hi>long,</hi> but all the while he puts forth mercy towards them, upholds their beings, feeds, heals, helps them. Sinners all the while they live, ſpend upon the ſtock of mercy; God is at much loſs, and great charges, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing thoſe mercies, which they ravel and wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way unprofitably. 6. He <hi>forbears to puniſh,</hi> without expecting any benefit to himſelf by it: If his <hi>long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering</hi> bring us to repentance, the good redounds to us: It is then (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>ſalvation.</hi> He loſeth nothing, if we be loſt; he hath no addition to his own happineſs, if we be happy. 7. He is <hi>patient and long-ſuffering</hi> to ſinners, who is much, nay infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely our ſuperior, and more excellent then are we. Here, a <hi>King,</hi> the King of kings waits for Beggars; our Lord and Maſter ſtands without at the door and knocks: Oh infinite condeſcention! How widely doth Gods carriage towards man, differ from mans towards man? We (poor worms) have ſhort thoughts; man will preſently upon every affront or neglect, be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to call <hi>fire from heaven;</hi> tis well for poor ſinning man, he hath to do with a <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> God: His fellow-creature could not, would not be ſo patient. God truly ſhewes himſelf a God, as well by ſparing, as by puniſhing: <hi>I am God and not man, and therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ſeed of Jacob are not deſtroyed.</hi> We further may gather, that its no ſign that men are innocent,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:166919:221"/>becauſe they are not puniſhed: It follows not, becauſe they are great, that therefore they are good; this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes only, God is good. Nor doth Gods forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance prove a ſinner pardoned, it only ſpeaks him for a time (though the Lord knows for how ſhort a time) reprieved. Juſtice is not <hi>dead,</hi> but <hi>ſleepeth.</hi> God is ſometimes ſaid to <hi>hold his peace,</hi> never to be <hi>dumb:</hi> though he be <hi>long-ſuffering,</hi> yet he is not <hi>ever-ſuffering.</hi> Gods patience, ſhewes not that God will <hi>alwaies ſpare</hi> us; but that we ſhould <hi>now repent.</hi> It is not a pillow for the preſumptuous, but a cordial for the penitent. God will require <hi>intereſt</hi> hereafter, for all his forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. The longer the Child is in the womb, the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger it will be when it comes forth. Judgment delay'd, will be increaſed, unleſs prevented. Juſtice comes ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though ſlowly to the impenitent; the <hi>blackneſs of darkneſs</hi> is <hi>reſerved for them,</hi> who are unprofitable un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der light: If <hi>Patience</hi> make thee not bluſh, <hi>Power</hi> ſhall make thee bleed. O thou (though) forborn ſinner, labour for faith in threatnings; take heed of ſelf love, and ſhunning the thoughts of that ſeverity, the feeling whereof, thou canſt not ſhun.

2. For the ſecond. The Spirit of God ſo exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentions the ſucceſſion of the Patriarchs of old, for ſundry reaſons: As firſt, To diſcover his care to keep, and uphold his Church, by ſhewing where it was, in what families it continued, and how it was by his goodneſſe preſerved and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated in all, even the worſt and moſt corrupt ages of the world: The poſterity of <hi>Cain</hi> was to be totally deſtroyed by the flood, and God ſwept them away with the beeſome of deſtruction; to what end therefore, ſhould they be ſo fully recorded? but the ſeed of <hi>Seth,</hi> was to be preſerved both in the deluge of waters, and of all ſucceeding calamities; and therefore their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcents and ſucceſſions are punctually recorded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. God hereby ſhewes the great delight which he took in ſpeaking of his Church and Children, and their concernments, above all other people in the world. The ſacred hiſtory mentions the poſterity of <hi>Cain,</hi> but occaſionally, and by the way, as the relation thereof had a neceſsary connexion with the hiſtory of the Church, and as making it more clear and complete; and therefore the ſcripture relates not either the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſions or actions of thoſe without the Church in a conſtant courſe or ſeries of hiſtory, nor doth it uſe that exactneſſe and induſtry in treating of them, which it uſeth in ſetting down the affaires of the Church.

                  <p n="1">1. To diſtinguiſh <hi>this Enoch</hi> from another of that name, who was the <hi>third from Adam,</hi> and of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, yea the immediate ſon of curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To ſhew how holy and zealous <hi>Enoch</hi> was in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful times. In a moſt diſsolute and prophane age, he propheſies of, and foretels the deſtruction of ſinners: Though he perhaps did them but little good by his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, yet they did him as little hurt by their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs. This taper was not extinguiſh'd by the damps of a ſinful generation; this ſtar ſhined brightly in a black night: <hi>Enoch</hi> the <hi>ſeventh,</hi> as afterward <hi>Noah</hi> the tenth from <hi>Adam, walked with God</hi> in a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt age, and did not only <hi>preſerve</hi> his <hi>own</hi> holineſſe, but propheſie againſt others unholineſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He cals <hi>Enoch the ſeventh from Adam,</hi> to gaine the more credit and eſteem to that propheſie, which he is about to mention, and the more to convince theſe ſeducers of the truth thereof; in regard both 1. of the great <hi>antiquity,</hi> and 2. the eminent <hi>piety</hi> of him who uttered this propheſie.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By the <hi>antiquity</hi> of a prophet who was the <hi>ſeventh from Adam,</hi> The Apoſtle wiſely inſinuates not only that even from the beginning of the world, holy men have propheſied of the end thereof; but that even then the miſerable end of the wicked was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told;
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:166919:228"/>and that they who were fartheſt remote from theſe ſeducers, and who therefore were moſt impartial, and could not be byaſt by affection to any fides or parties, propheſied of their overthrow.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By the eminent and renowned <hi>piety</hi> of this <hi>Enoch, the ſeventh from Adam,</hi> who <hi>walked</hi> ſo cloſely <hi>with God,</hi> and did ſo <hi>pleaſe God,</hi> that he accounted him too good to live long upon earth, and would not ſtay for his company in heaven, til he had finiſh'd the ordinary time of living, but took him to himſelf, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had lived to half the years either of his father, or of his ſon. I ſay, by this admirable holineſs of <hi>Enoch, Jude</hi> might ſtop the mouths of theſe ſeducers, and render them either unable to reſiſt the evidence of this propheſie, or inexcuſable in not ſubmitting to it.</p>
                  <p>This eminent holineſs of <hi>Enoch,</hi> is in Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in theſe words, <hi>He walked with God;</hi> words few in number, but great in weight; and which (upon this apt occaſion) I ſhall briefly explain.</p>
                  <p>By this <hi>walking with God,</hi> more <hi>generally,</hi> is rather intended, his giving up himſelf to the worſhip and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of God, in the leading a <hi>hooy life,</hi> then a <hi>peculiar Miniſtration,</hi> in the diſcharging the office of the prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; this walking with God, being the ſame with his <hi>walking in the way of Gods commandments;</hi> and his ordering the whole courſe and frame of his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation according to the will and commadment of God; and this metaphor of <hi>walking with God,</hi> is taken from two friends, unanimouſly and willingly going the ſame courſe and path together as companions. More <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly</hi> this his <hi>walking with God,</hi> 1. Intends a <hi>ſetting of God before his eyes,</hi> and a living alwaies as in his ſight, and as being preſent with him, and thereby his humble reverencing of, and fearing to offend God, and a ſtudying to pleaſe him, and to approve himſelf to him, (<hi>walk before me, and be thou perfect, Gen.</hi>

He walked with God <hi>ſolely,</hi> he admitted no intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders into, or diſturbers of his heavenly converſes with his God; the world followed him as a <hi>ſervant,</hi> walked not with him as a <hi>companion:</hi> (this God cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide) he rather uſed the world, than enjoyed it; or rather <hi>uſed it as if he uſed it not:</hi> God cannot bear the the company of <hi>Mammon;</hi> the love of God and the world cannot ſtand together. 2. He walked with God <hi>evenly,</hi> and in a direct courſe; he <hi>halted</hi> not, like the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> 1 <hi>King.</hi> 18.21. <hi>between two:</hi> he made <hi>ſtraight pathes for his feet;</hi> he gave allowance to no wandrings, nor <hi>falſe waies;</hi> they who wil walk in <hi>by<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paths,</hi> walk not with God, but alone; and therefore <hi>Enoch walked</hi> in a ſtraight path to heaven, and turned not aſide to <hi>crooked waies,</hi> not treading in the way of any known ſin. 3. He walked <hi>cheerfully,</hi> not unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly or conſtrainedly, or ſadly, his walking being with him who is the God of all comfort: and indeed, God takes no pleaſure in that mans company, who accounts not walking with him a <hi>pleaſure; Enoch</hi> was not by fear, or force, or reſtraint detained before the Lord, but he <hi>delighted himſelf in him,</hi> looking upon holy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as his <hi>priviledges</hi> as wel as <hi>his tasks:</hi> nor indeed can any walk cheerfully, but when with God; his company makes the valley of <hi>the ſhadow of death</hi> to be a pleaſant way, a bitter condition ſweet, and a ſweet condition
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:166919:230"/>ſweeter. 4. He walked <hi>conſtantly,</hi> unweariedly with God, <hi>from ſtrength to ſtrength,</hi> til he appeared before him in the heavenly Sion. <hi>Enochs</hi> goodneſs was not by fits and ſtarts, like that of ſome hypocrites; he did not take a ſtep or two, but <hi>walked with God:</hi> this his walking with God, laſted as long as his continuing in the world; he did not ſet out wel only in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, but held out wel alſo, til the end of his race.</p>

<pb n="459" facs="tcp:166919:235"/>to us that rare treaſure. And that <hi>Moſes</hi> was the firſt of all the holy writers, I think is the conſtant judgment of all learned divines, proteſtant and popiſh; nor doth Chriſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. acknowledg any holy writer to be more ancient then <hi>Moſes;</hi> for <hi>Luke</hi> 24.27. it is ſaid, that <hi>beginning at Moſes, he expounded unto them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himſelf.</hi> Now if <hi>Enoch</hi> had written a book, probable it is, that Chriſt would have begun at him, (he being ſo long before <hi>Moſes</hi>) to have explained the propheſies of his humility and glory; the later whereof this propheſie of <hi>Enoch</hi> here mentioned by <hi>Jude,</hi> doth ſo clearly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover. Its therefore the opinion of ſome learned men, that if there were in <hi>Judes</hi> time any writing which went under <hi>Enochs name,</hi> it was written by ſome Jewes, who mixed ſome things Good and true, (which peradventure they received by tradition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the propheſies of <hi>Enoch</hi>) with other things falſe and fabulous; which book of theirs might be more and more in the progreſs of time corrupted, and was deſervedly rejected as Apocryphal. Poſſibly out of this Book <hi>Jude</hi> might take this paſſage. The penmen of holy Scripture, have (not ſeldome) taken ſeveral paſſages which tended to edification, out of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane
<note n="*" place="margin">Acts 17.28. 1 Cor. 15.33.

<pb n="460" facs="tcp:166919:236"/>publiſh and ſet forth a book under the name of <hi>Enoch,</hi> that ſo by its bearing the name of one ſo pious and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it might find the better acceptance. Of this o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion is the learned <hi>Gomarus,</hi> who withal gives a paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel inſtance of the feigning of an epiſtle, (under <hi>Pauls</hi> name) to be written to the <hi>Laodiceans,</hi> by occaſion of that paſſage of <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 4.16. ſo that according to this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, ſome took occaſion to write this fictitious book of <hi>Enoch,</hi> by reading of <hi>Judes</hi> Epiſtle: not that <hi>Jude</hi> ever ſaw any book under <hi>Enochs</hi> name extant, or took his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie out of it. Many learned men therefore very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably conceive, that our Apoſtle received this propheſie from common and <hi>undoubted tradition</hi> tranſmitted from the Patriarchs, and ſo handed from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration; til ſuch time as it ſeemed good, to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt by the Apoſtle <hi>Jude,</hi> to make it a part of Scripture. And thus the Apoſtle mentions the with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of <hi>Moſes by Jannes, and Jambres; Jacobs wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping upon the top of his ſtaffe; Moſes his ſaying that the ſight upon the mount was ſo terrible, that I exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly fear and quake.</hi> Thus it is ſaid <hi>that Joſephs feet were hurt with fetters, and that he was laid in irons;</hi> all which paſſages, being no where mentioned in their proper ſtories, were received by tradition from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to generation; the Spirit of God nevertheleſs ſanctifying them, and giving them the ſtamp of divine authority, to be moſt certain and infallible, by putting the penmen of holy writ to inſert them into the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. And by this which hath been ſaid, we anſwer, thoſe who argue againſt the canonicalneſs of this E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle, from <hi>Judes</hi> alledging (as they conceive) an apocriphal Author, or his bringing in a tradition no where recorded in Scripture, the
<note n="*" place="margin">If be did cite it out of any Author.</note> citing of theſe by our Apoſtle, being ſo far from making him apocryphal, that he makes them (ſo far as he uſeth them) canonical: as alſo, we hereby anſwer the Papiſts, who becauſe the Apoſtles have ſometimes transferred ſome things from
<pb n="461" facs="tcp:166919:236"/>humane writings and tradition, into holy Scripture; take the boldneſs to doe the like alſo, and to joyn tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions with the holy Scripture; they not conſidering that they want that ſpirit of diſcerning which the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had, who by making uſe of traditions, gave them divine authority. They were immediately acted by the holy Ghoſt in all their writings; but we are not endowed with the ſame meaſure of the Spirit, and therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are able nor ought to imitate them herein.</p>

                     <hi>ten thouſands</hi> in this place, we are likewiſe to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand holy <hi>men,</hi> as wel as the holy <hi>Angels;</hi> even the Saints <hi>ſhall appear with him in glory, Col.</hi> 3.4. And more plainly, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.13. the coming of our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> is foretold to be <hi>with all his Saints.</hi> And <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.43. <hi>The righteous ſhal ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdome of their father;</hi> and theſe ſaints or righteous ones who are to attend upon Chriſt, ſhall be not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thoſe who before were with Chriſt in heaven, but even thoſe who ſhal be <hi>taken up in the clouds to meet Chriſt,</hi> and thereby ſhall be made a part of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. So that theſe myriads, this <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable company</hi> ſhal be made up of all the glorious Angels and Saints; it ſhal be a <hi>general aſſembly;</hi> all the ſervants ſhal wait upon their Maſter the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. We ſhall (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>all meet, Epheſ.</hi> 4.13. there ſhall not be one wanting: and if Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowes new liveries upon all his Saints, they ſhall all, when adorned with them, yeild their attendance to him, in them.</p>
                  <p>But in what reſpect doth the Apoſtle call them <hi>Saints</hi> or <hi>Holy?</hi> Perſons are <hi>holy</hi> in two reſpects. 1. In reſpect of <hi>deſtination,</hi> ſeperation, or being ſet apart to holy ſervices and employments. Thus the <hi>firſt-born</hi> were holy, <hi>Exod.</hi> 13.2 12.
<note place="margin">Jer. 1.5.</note> Thus the Prophets and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles are oft called holy: <hi>Jeremiah</hi> was <hi>ſanctified</hi> from the womb. In this reſpect theſe holy Angels and men may be called holy, as being ſet apart to the peculiar work, and glorious employment of praiſing and glorifying of God for ever. 2. Perſons may be <hi>holy</hi> in reſpect of true <hi>inherent holineſs</hi> abiding in them; thus likewiſe theſe Angels and Saints here mentioned may be called holy: for the <hi>Angels,</hi> they were from their very creation perfectly holy, and afterward by the grace of confirmation made conſtant in holineſſe: as for <hi>holy men,</hi> though they were formerly made ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of <hi>not holy, privatively,</hi> that is, having loſt their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,
<pb n="476" facs="tcp:166919:244"/>had holineſs beſtowed upon them by regenera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and though they were made holy <hi>of leſſe holy,</hi> by having increaſe and additions of holineſſe beſtowed upon them in this life, yet at <hi>this great day,</hi> they are with the Angels perfectly holy likewiſe, the <hi>ſpirits of juſt men made perfect;</hi> in this life they were <hi>perficientes,</hi> perfecting; then ſhal they be <hi>perfecti,</hi> having as much holineſs as they can hold; as much as God or themſelves wil deſire, being without any mixtures of unholineſſe in them, all teares being wiped from their eyes, and all ſins from their ſouls, and they preſented <hi>faultleſſe before that preſence of glory, not having ſpot or wrinkle or any ſuch thing, but being holy and without blemiſh. Eph.</hi> 5.27.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the third, they are called <hi>his, his holy ten thouſands;</hi> and his they are in three reſpects. 1. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of <hi>Creation,</hi> he made them all, whether Saints or Angels; as they are creatures, they are the <hi>works of his hands.</hi> 2. As they are <hi>Saints,</hi> they are <hi>his</hi> alſo, Angels are his by being <hi>confirmed</hi> in their ſanctity: Holy men are his, becauſe he was the <hi>deſerving</hi> cauſe of their holineſs, the pattern or <hi>exemplary cauſe</hi> alſo thereof; and laſtly, by his ſpirit, the <hi>efficient cauſe</hi> of their holineſs, he is <hi>made ſanctification</hi> to us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. <hi>he ſanctifies and cleanſeth his Church with the waſhing of water by the word.</hi> 3. They are <hi>his,</hi> in point of <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>attendance;</hi> for being ſanctifyed, they wait upon him, and ſerve him in all holy employments here in the kingdome of <hi>grace,</hi> and hereafter ſhall they attend upon, and come with him as his ſervants in his kingdome of glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. For the fourth, their <hi>coming with</hi> the Lord Jeſus; theſe <hi>ten thouſands of his Saints,</hi> ſhall come <hi>with</hi> him.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For <hi>his own glory, he wil come in the glory of his holy Angels,</hi> and he wil likewiſe <hi>come to be glorified in his Saints, and admired in all thoſe that believe in

The ungodly ſhall be convinced of the moſt concealed wickedneſſes, and their mouth ſhall be ſhut ſo ſoon as ever Gods book is opened. We may delude men, we cannot deceive God: they cannot convince, unleſſe men be witneſſes againſt thee; God will convince thee by making thine own Conſcience to witneſſe for him againſt thee. Yea, of thoſe ſins which are unknown to thee, ſhalt thou be convinced by him who knoweth all things.

If it be enquired why the Apoſtle onely here ſaith <hi>ungodly,</hi> and not <hi>unrighteous</hi> deeds alſo, Its anſwered, for three reſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Becauſe <hi>ungodlineſs</hi> and <hi>unrighteouſneſs</hi> are inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable: whereſoever ungodlineſs is, there will be no Conſcience made of unrighteouſneſs: as the two tables were given, ſo are they broken and embraced both together, and he who breaks one, makes no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of breaking the other, the authority of the giver being the ſame.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Becauſe ungodlineſſe is the <hi>cauſe</hi> of unrighte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe: he who hath a prophane godleſs heart, will not ſtick at any act of unjuſtice. Tis the <hi>fear of God which is to depart from evill.</hi> As holineſſe puts a man upon righteouſneſſe, ſo prophaneneſſe upon unrighteouſneſſe. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> knew not God, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he oppreſt Iſrael.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Becauſe theſe ſeducers flatterd themſelves with
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:166919:250"/>pretences of eminent godlineſſe and holineſs; though they took a liberty to live in many vices and unclean extravagancies: The Apoſtle ſeveral times in this Epiſtle, brands them with the name of ungodly ones, and threatens judgment for their ungodlineſs.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. <hi>By purpoſing and intending of ſin.</hi> The wicked is

                  <p n="2">2. Ungodly deeds are performed after an <hi>ungodly manner,</hi> by <hi>deviſing and contriving of ungodlineſs; the wicked deviſe miſchief, Prov.</hi> 6.14. <hi>He that deviſeth to do evil,

                  <p n="3">3.

Sin is as pleaſant to ſinners, as bread and wine; <hi>they eat the bread of wickedneſs, and drink the cup of violence; they rejoyce to doe evill, and delight in the frowardneſs of the wicked, Prov.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Wickedneſs is ſweet in their mouths, and they hide it under their tongues, Job.</hi> 20.12. as it is not the <hi>doing</hi> of good, but the <hi>delighting</hi> in the doing it that makes it done wel, ſo neither is it ſimply the <hi>doing</hi> of evil, but the doing thereof <hi>delightfully,</hi> that makes it done <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godlily.

<pb n="502" facs="tcp:166919:257"/>weak and impotent; Gods was holy and righteous, and withal potent and irreſiſtible: Man hath no abilitie with his anger, he may hate God, but he cannot hurt him; nay, in ſtead thereof, he only hurts himſelf; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very arrow which he ſhoots up to God, falling down upon his own pate.</p>

Now how great an impiety is it, to lament and complaine more for the want of trifles, then for the want of that great ſoul-ſatisfying good, namely, that God who hath all in him that may do or make us good! like a fooliſh mother, who having many lovely children, will not look upon <hi>them,</hi> but only regards &amp; delights her ſelf with babies, or puppets made of clouts. How deſervedly great is that complaint of God, <hi>they have forſaken me the fountaine of living waters, and have hewed them out Ciſterns, broken Ciſterns that can hold no waters!</hi> How inexcuſable a wickedneſſe was it for the King of Iſrael, in ſtead of ſeeking of God, to goe to <hi>Baalzebub the God of Ekron</hi> for the recovery of his health! What greater diſloyalty then for a ſoul, like <hi>Potiphars</hi> wife, to wrangle and rage becauſe it cannot obtaine its ſervant (the Creature) to ſatisfie its uncleane deſires, and to deſpiſe the chaſt and truly comfortable imbracements of her Lord, to whom its marryed, and tyed by <hi>deareſt and ſtricteſt bonds.</hi>

<pb n="505" facs="tcp:166919:258"/>
                     <hi>the great ſinne of unthankfulneſſe</hi> for what portion we enjoy. A murmurer cannot be thankful, nor can he who is thankful for what he hath, murmur for what he is without; but he wonders that God ſhould give him any thing, not frets becauſe God doth not give him every thing; he ſaith (with <hi>Jacob) I am leſs then the least of all thy mercies;</hi> and doth not mutter againſt God for not beſtowing upon him greater. This di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper of diſcontent (contrarily) cauſeth men to think ſo much of what they want, that they quite for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get what they already have received: Thus the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites</hi> diſcontentedly murmured for what they had not, and unthankfully forgat what they had. Diſconted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe makes heavy mercies to ſink to the bottome, and to be forgotten; and light wants and troubles to ſwim on the top; and it makes men ſo fretful, in that a few are above them, that they are utterly unthankful for their being above ſo many; and God loſeth a friend of the diſcontented perſon, for but doing with his own as he pleaſeth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>In this is manifeſted the ſin of a proud conceit of our own worth</hi> and deſervings, a ſinful ſelf-juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when Gods diſpenſations are ſevere and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive. He who complains of Gods dealing, ſecretly applauds his own deſervings; he who murmurs againſt Gods hand, ſhewes that he is not angry with his own heart; he alwaies ſaith, ſee what have I loſt, how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny comforts do I want; but he never ſaith, <hi>what have I done?</hi> how many corruptions hath my heart, which make me unfit to enjoy a fuller portion in the world? All the fault is laid upon God, nothing upon himſelf, as if his ſin never threw one mite into the treaſury of his ſufferings, he counts God a hard maſter, and himſelf a good ſervant: and if it be a great ſin in the courts of men to acquit the wicked, and to condemn the innocent, how inexcuſable a wickedneſſe is it to condemn God, and acquit our ſelves! A diſcontented camplainer ſaith not
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:166919:259"/>with <hi>David, I and my fathers houſe have ſinned: theſe ſheep, what have they don?</hi> Nor with the humble ſoul, <hi>The Lord is righteous, and I wil bear the indignation of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned againſt him;</hi> but flyes in the face of God, in ſtead of falling down at his feet. In one word; this diſcontent is a ſhield for ſin, and is a ſword againſt God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5.

                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>ſecond,</hi> what admiring of perſons is to be condemned as unlawfull. Certainly all kind of admiring of perſons is not unlawfull before God, nor diſallowed by this Apoſtle. Honour to the perſons of others may lawfully be given; Even for thoſe gifts and endowments wherewith God hath furniſht them, whether outward or inward: for the outward glory and <hi>majeſty</hi> which God <hi>gave Nabuchadnezar,</hi> all <hi>people trembled and feared before him,</hi> Dan. 5.19.

But ſeverall wayes admiring of perſous is unlawfull. I ſhall reduce them all to theſe <hi>two</hi> heads.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. As this admiration of man doth more particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerne 1. God.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. As it may concern God. And thus we admire men ſinfully. 1. When we ſo admire man, as that we honour him <hi>without</hi> eying Gods Command: the loweſt ſervice muſt be done in obedience to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt maſter: our earthly parent muſt be honoured and admired becauſe our heavenly Father injoynes it. An Earthly maſter muſt not be honoured and ſerved with an eye onely to <hi>his</hi> Command, but out of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of duty to Gods Command. Herein muſt we reſemble that noble <hi>Roman</hi> who diſdaining to bow before a forreigne Prince, when he came into his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, let fall his ring, which he ſtooping to take up, and thereupon the Prince inſulting, the <hi>Roman</hi> utters theſe, words, <hi>Non tibi, ſed annulo; I bow not to thee, but to take up my ring.</hi> Or as that <hi>Frederick Barbaroſſa,</hi>
                     <pb n="537" facs="tcp:166919:274"/>who kneeling down before the Pope to receive his Crowne, ſaid, <hi>Non tibi ſed Petro, not to thee but to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> The Apoſtle makes the application, when he injoynes ſervants to be <hi>obedient unto Maſters, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, not as men-pleaſers, but as the ſervants of Chriſt,</hi> Eph. 6.6, 7. and <hi>not as men-pleaſers, but &amp;c. fearing God. Col.</hi> 3.22.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>When we ſo admire men as to honour and ſerve them</hi> in thoſe things which they <hi>command againſt God:</hi> our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lord muſt be <hi>obey'd,</hi> but our heavenly Lord muſt be <hi>preferred.</hi> When theſe two come in Competition, we are diſobedient unleſſe we be diſobedient. Againſt my heavenly fathers will, I neither owe buriall to my dead, nor obedience to my living Father. <hi>Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be right to obey God or man</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>judg you. Ephraim was oppreſſed and broken in judgment, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he willingly walked after the Commandement.</hi> Hoſ. 5.11.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When we ſo admire men</hi> for any excellency as <hi>not to give the glory thereof to God,</hi> the ſweetneſſe of the ſtream muſt not make us forget the fountain. Men muſt be honoured as inſtruments, not adored as dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. It was curſed, and it proved coſtly flattery which was given to <hi>Herod,</hi> when the people ſhouted, <hi>It is the voice of God,</hi> and <hi>not of a man;</hi> becauſe <hi>he gave not God the glory, he was ſmitten, and eaten up of wormes,</hi> Act. 12.22, 23. That muſt not be offered to any which the beſt never durſt take, namely, the praiſe of having or doing any thing of themſelves. How fearfull have ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men been in their higheſt performances, leſt any of Gods glory ſhould cleave to their fingers! When <hi>Peter</hi> had wrought that great Miracle of healing the creeple, and the people greatly wondered, fearing the ſinfull admiring of his perſon, he takes all from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and caſts all upon Chriſt. <hi>Yee men of Iſrael:</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>why look ye ſtedfaſtly upon us, as though by our own power or holineſſe, We had made this man to walk?
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:166919:275"/>The God of Abraham &amp;c. hath glorified his Son Jeſus, &amp;c. Barnabas and Paul</hi> rent their clothes when the people were about to ſacrifice to them. I <hi>laboured</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) more abundantly then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. <hi>Our ſufficiency is of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.5. <hi>Who is Paul, or who is Apollo, but Miniſters by whom ye beleeved? I have planted, Apollo watered, but God gave the increaſe. So then neither is he that planteth any thing,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 3.5, 6, 7. the <hi>Corinthians</hi> faith was not to <hi>ſtand in the wiſdome of men, but power of God,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5, 39. People are commonly in extreames; either they deifie men, or nullifie them. Either they make them dwarfs or Gyants; but for people ſo to admire any men as to aſcribe their converſion, or edification to them; as if men were not onely Gods inſtruments and Chriſts ſervants, but Gods and Chriſts themſelves; and as if their grace were from the abilities of the teacher, and not from the power of Chriſt, is a very plainly ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full admiring of mens perſons, even to an unchair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt, and a lifting up of man into his Seat; to a depriving the ſhepherd and Biſhop of our ſoules, and a ſubſtituting another in his roome. In a word, It is all one, as to thanke the ax for building the houſe, and to attribute nothing to the Carpenter. Nor indeed is it any other than idolatry.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>When we ſo admire</hi> and honour men, as to put that truſt and <hi>Confidence in them,</hi> which we owe on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to God. Thou (ſaith <hi>Job</hi>) art my <hi>confidence.</hi> Job. 31.24. <hi>He is the confidence of the ends of all the earth.</hi> Pſ. 65.5. <hi>Put your truſt in the Lord.</hi> Pſal. 4.5. <hi>Truſt in him at all times.</hi> Pſ. 62.5. ſo Pſal. 37.3. But men, though never ſo full of love, skill, ſtrength, muſt not have our truſt. <hi>Put not confidence in a guide.</hi> Mic. 7.5. It is better to <hi>truſt in the Lord then to put confidence in Princes,</hi> Pſal. 118.8. <hi>Every man at his beſt ſtate is altogether va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</hi> Pſ. 39.5. <hi>Ceaſe from man whoſe breath is in his
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:166919:275"/>noſtrils, for wherein is he to be accounted of?</hi> Iſa. 2.22. Man is to be us'd as a wand in our hand, not lean'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as our ſtaffe or ſupport; in ſubordination to, not ſin ſtead of God; onely as one that can help us, if God will help him; as one that of himſelfe cannot move, or undertake, much leſs accompliſh any good for us. Oh how oft hath God ſnapt in ſunder all theſe rotten crutches in <hi>England!</hi> and how many lectures of vanity hath he read upon men in greateſt admiration!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>When we ſo admire men as to fear their power</hi> more then Gods. Men are ſinfully admired, both when (they being for us) appear to us ſo great as that God <hi>need</hi> not help us; &amp; when (they being againſt us) they appear ſo great as that God <hi>cannot</hi> help us. Man is idolized both by looking upon him as one that can work <hi>without</hi> God, &amp; much more by looking upon him as able to work <hi>againſt</hi> God. How ſinfully did the Iſraelites admire the perſons of the <hi>Gyants</hi> in <hi>Canaan,</hi> in reſpect of ther ſtrength and ſtature! How ſinfully did <hi>David</hi> admire <hi>Saul,</hi> when againſt Gods promiſe he ſaid, he ſhould <hi>periſh by his hand!</hi> thus the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> ſinfully admire the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> when upon the ſight of them, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the word and works of God, they tell <hi>Moſes</hi> in their march, that <hi>he tooke them away to dye in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe.</hi> Exod. 14.11. <hi>Who art thou, that thou ſhouldſt be afraid of a man that ſhall dye &amp;c? and forgetteſt the Lord thy maker.</hi> Iſa. 51.12. The fearing of man is the forgetting of God.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When we admire mens goodneſs, or what of God we ſee in men, their perſons, loving the meſſage for the meſſenger, the liquor for the veſſel, holy inſtruction for the ſake of him who gives it; and ſo hearing the <hi>word of God</hi> as the word of man; this is to prefer a man of God before God in a man, or rather man before God. And (contrary to what <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks) not to judg of perſons by faith, but of faith by perſons.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Admiration of perſons is <hi>ſinful as it concerns Man.</hi>
                     <pb n="540" facs="tcp:166919:276"/>and 1. As it concerns <hi>the admired,</hi> and ſo admiration of perſons is ſinfull.</p>

Some weak braines will be turn'd with a ſmall quantity of wine; others more ſtrong will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure more. <hi>Herod</hi> was intoxicated with applauſe, when the people cryde him up for a God; but <hi>Paul and Barnabas</hi> rend their clothes, and are ready to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice themſelves when the people meditate a ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing to them. A weak ſtomack cannot concoct fat morſells, he is a man of ſtrong grace, who can hear his own commendations without hurt. Nothing more diſcovers a man then the praiſing him. Its as the <hi>fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning pot for ſilver, and the furnace for gold,</hi> Prov. 27.21.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we ſo admire perſons, as thereby to <hi>make a prey of them,</hi> or to overthrow either their bodies or ſoules. Thus the <hi>Herodians,</hi> Matth. 22.16. admired and honoured <hi>Chriſt,</hi> telling him that he was <hi>true,</hi> and <hi>taught the way of God in truth, and regarded not the perſon of man;</hi> but all this was but to intangle and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy him, by bringing him on to anſwer to a captious queſtion. Thus afterward Chriſt was betrayd with a kiſſe; and not ſeldome have we known that men have laine in ambuſh behinde the thickets of commenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admiration, and ſo unſuſpectedly, faln upon the unwary and credulous hearer. <hi>Jael</hi> gives her nail ſoon after her milk, and poyſon is oftneſt drunke in gold. Thus after the death of <hi>Jehoiadah,</hi> the Princes of <hi>Judah,</hi> came and made <hi>obeyſance</hi> to King <hi>Joaſh,</hi> whereby they prevaild with him to leave the <hi>houſe of the Lord,
<note place="margin">2 Chr. 24.17.</note> and to ſerve groves and Idols:</hi> and thus (as Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical hiſtory tells us) <hi>Simon Magus</hi> cry'd up <hi>Nere</hi> above the clouds, and accounted and cald him a God, to make him the greater Enemy to the Chriſtians.
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:166919:276"/>Thus <hi>Tertullus</hi> admired the perſon of <hi>Felix,</hi> that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he might ſtir him up againſt <hi>Paul.</hi> Act. 24.2.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>When we ſo admire perſons, as to cover, hide and excuſe their ſin</hi> becauſe of their greatneſſe. A ſin the greater, in regard that greatneſſe ought to be ſo far from being a cloke for, that it is an aggravation of ſin and makes it the more hainous. A wicked perſon in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe is but a <hi>vile perſon,</hi> &amp; by ſo much the more vile, by how much the more he corrupts and abuſes any eminent gifts and endowments which God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him. The word ſpeaks as baſely of rich wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, as they think contemptibly of Gods people That wicked King was very low in the eyes of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, who ſaid, <hi>were it not that I regard the perſon of Jehoſhap at King of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor ſee thee,</hi> 2 King. 3.14. See more of this before pag. 2. part 14. Unſanctified greatneſſe is moſt likely to be pernitious, and therefore ſhould be moſt reprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Admiration of perſons is ſinfull as it concernes the admirer,</hi> and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>When we ſo admire perſons, as thereby onely to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and advantage our ſelves, and that</hi> 1. either in <hi>profit</hi> and gaine: or 2. in honour or reputation. 1. In pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit: and thus theſe ſeducers here admired great ones, and honoured their greatneſſe for their own <hi>ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage,</hi> ſervilly cringing and crouching to them for <hi>filthy lucre:</hi> they gave them great titles, and flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered them in ſin, and aſſented to them in every thing, that they might fill their purſes, and (as <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>through covetouſneſſe, did</hi> they <hi>with feined words</hi> make <hi>merchandiſe of people,</hi> hereby ſhewing that they nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerved Chriſt, nor indeed thoſe whom they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terd, but their <hi>own bellies:</hi> at once laying off both the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> and the <hi>Man.</hi> 2. In <hi>honour and</hi> and reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and for this end ſometimes the perſons of <hi>great</hi> men, are admired, as Mr <hi>Fox</hi> tells us that the bloody
<pb n="542" facs="tcp:166919:277"/>Tyger <hi>Steph. Gardiner</hi> was wont to admire the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Henry</hi> the 8. ſpeaking of him to others with greateſt honour, and calling him his gracious Lord and Maſter, onely to be lookt upon as his favourite, though he knew that the King never loved him. But for honour, hypocrites commonly admire the perſons of <hi>good men,</hi> admire their perſons (I ſay) though they imitate not their practiſes. Thus <hi>Saul</hi> deſired the preſence of <hi>Samuel, to be honoured before the people.</hi> Thus the <hi>Scribes and Phariſes</hi> admired the <hi>dead Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets,</hi> onely to be accounted (as they were) holy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>When we ſo admire perſons as withall to imitate their ſins</hi> and imperfections. Thus theſe ſeducers were ſo admired, as that many followed their <hi>damnable errors,</hi> putting no difference between their faces and the warts, their <hi>ſpeaking and ſtammering.</hi> The falls and folly of the admired, are commonly the ſnares of the admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers; and the <hi>error of the maſter</hi> oft the tentation of the ſcholar. Its very hard to admire the perſon of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and not to imitate his imperfections.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Admiration of perſons is ſinfull as it <hi>concernes and hurts others:</hi> and ſo</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When for ſome commendable actions or endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, we ſo admire a perſon who is in moſt things very diſcommendable, and a known wicked perſon that thereby we give occaſion to the hearer, who is though wicked, yet not ſo wicked as he, to judg his own condition very good, and to bleſſe and flatter himſelfe in his ſin, as thinking that he deſerves Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation as well as, or better then the other. This I have ever thought to be one ſtratagem whereby the hands of the wicked have been ſtrengthned in ſin; and a ſtumbling block which ſome either weakly or wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have laid before others. Thus I have oft heard even with grief, when in funerall Sermons, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane drunkard, a ſwearer, an adulterer, or one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps at the moſt but civilly honeſt, hath for ſome
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:166919:277"/>few good deeds, been cryed up and even ſainted by the Preacher, that the wickedeſt perſons have been rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſaint themſelves, and to ſay, If ſuch an one were commendable, and voiced by our Miniſter for a good man, I thank God, tis much better with me, I never was guilty of halfe his extravagancies, and I ſee I may be a good man, yea and commended when I am dead, notwithſtanding my failings, (ſo he calls his al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed wickedneſſes) though I be not ſo pure as ſuch and ſuch are. Oh how unſutable is it, that by fune<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Sermons men ſhould be made more unfit for death! to paint thoſe in the pulpit who are puniſht in hell, and that a Miniſter ſhould be ſtrewing that dead body with flowers, whoſe ſoule is bathing in flames! For my part, though I ſhould not deny due commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, even at a funerall, to ſome eminently exemplary ſaint, or publiquely uſefull inſtrument; yet moſtly, I thinke his ſpeech concerning the deceaſed may ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, who ſaid, If he were good, he did not deſire; If bad, he did not deſerve praiſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When we ſo admire the perſons of <hi>ſome inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters,</hi> as to neglect and deſpiſe others who haply de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve better then they: the ſin of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> when the Apoſtle tells them, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.21. of their <hi>glorying in men,</hi> ſome teachers being ſo gloried in peculiarly, as if they were onely worth the hearing, and none elſe to be regarded. Some accounted <hi>Paul</hi> the only tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, ſome delighted onely in <hi>Apollo,</hi> ſome magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Peter</hi> as the alone worthy man; thus they <hi>thought of men above what was meet,</hi> and they were <hi>puffed up for one againſt another.</hi> They gloryed in ſome, diſdain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all others as not to be named with them, though teachers of the ſame truth; becauſe they had an high conceit of their learning, wit, cloquence, holineſſe, or the like qualifications. A great ſin doubtleſſe, and (I fear) the common ſin of this City. How unthankfull for the bounty of Chriſt, doe men make themſelves
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:166919:278"/>hereby, who gave all the Miniſters of the Goſpell to be theirs for their good! (<hi>all things</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>are yours, whether Paul, or Apollo, or Cephas,</hi> 1 Cor. 3.21, 22.) Its unthankfulneſſe to a bountifull Prince, when he beſtowes many Lordſhips on his favourite, if he ſhould regard one of them onely, and deſpiſe all the reſt. Yea how injuriouſly is the Spirit of Chriſt hereby reproached! For the deſpiſing of thoſe who are of ſmall gifts, is a reproaching of the Spirit of God, as if he were defective in his gifts; whereas their variety ſets forth the fulneſſe and freeneſſe of Gods ſpirit, who <hi>divideth to every man ſeverally as he will,</hi> and <hi>worketh all theſe,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.11. Beſides, this ſin is oft the maine cauſe of ſchiſmes in the Church. It makes people to divide themſelves under different teachers whom they admire, and it cauſeth teachers to take away thoſe that affect them, from other teachers whom they affect not ſo much. Now this ſin of ſchiſme (in it ſelfe very great (as afterwards ſhall be ſhewn, God willing, on the 19. ver.) is made much the greater by being occaſion'd by thoſe very gifts of men, which God beſtowed upon them to this end, that there <hi>might be no ſciſme in the body, but that the members ſhould have the ſame care one of another,</hi> 1 Cor. 12.25. Nor is there any ſin which doth more expoſe Chriſtian Religion to ſo much contempt and obloquy, then this kinde of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miring of perſons; for hereby ſeverall Companies of Chriſtians are made like the ſeverall ſchools of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, ſome whereof followed <hi>Plato,</hi> ſome <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtotle,</hi> ſome <hi>Epicurus;</hi> and the doctrines of faith are but accounted as the proper opinions of ſeverall tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, and all zeal for them is conceived to ariſe not from a certaine knowledge of heavenly truth; but from peculiar humour and ſtrength of fancy. And how great <hi>a ſtumbling block</hi> muſt this needs be to thoſe who are <hi>without,</hi> how will it hinder them from em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing the truth, and lay it open to deriſion? yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:166919:278"/>the ſinfulneſs of this ſort of man-admiration ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in that hereby both the deſpiſed perſon is ſo greived and diſcouraged, that he is infeebled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled in his work, and alſo he who is admired, is not onely puffed up with pride, and thereby occaſion'd to adulterate the word, invent and broach errors, that ſtil he may be advanced above all others by going in a different way from them; but alſo put upon the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of men by ſinfull flatteries, in ſtead of profiting them by faithfull reprehenſions: To conclude this conſideration, nothing begets ſo great an aptneſs in men to receive errors, as this ſinfull admiration; nor hath any ſeed of hereſies and ſuperſtitions proved ſo fruitfull as this; affection commonly makes men take down falſities, and error is eaſily received from them whom we much admire; and God doth often leave ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired teachers to erre, for tryal of the people, and the puniſhing of their vanity in making Gods truth to ſtand at the devotion of the teacher, for its acceptance, and trampling upon the holy and (perhaps) learned labours of thoſe who are more ſeeing and faithfull than the admired.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When <hi>we ſo admire mens perſons</hi> as to give all reſpect <hi>to men in outward</hi> greatneſſe, (though perhaps wicked) deſpifing the poor Saints, becauſe poor; this <hi>James</hi> reproves, <hi>my brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt in reſpect of perſons, James</hi> 2. When wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in robes is magnified, and holineſſe in raggs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. Oh how unworthy is it that the gold ring, and coſtly apparell ſhould be prefer'd before the robe of Chriſts righteouſneſſe, and the jewel of grace! that godlineſs and good examples, ſhould be rejected for their want of a gold ring, that he who ſhall have a throne in heaven, muſt here be a footſtool upon earth!</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When <hi>Elections and offices</hi> are paſſed and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed partially, for freindſhip, favour, money, kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:166919:279"/>a ſin by much agravated, when men have taken oaths to a Corporation to the contrary, and its oſt a great tentation to the party who enters by money, to ſell juſtice dear.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>When we ſo admire the perſon of one, as to do injuſtice in judgment,</hi> whether <hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> which is when our affection doth ſo blind our judgment by ſome outward reſpect or appearance, that we will not determine righteouſly, the cauſe being over ballanced with ſuch forreign conſiderations as have no affinity with it. Thus men are in judicature ſometime ſwayed with fooliſh pitty, ſometime with cowardly fear; both theſe the Lord forbids. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.15. <hi>Thou ſhalt not reſpect the perſon of the poor,
<note place="margin">Deut. 1.17.</note> nor honour the perſon of the mighty.</hi> This ſin would make God a patron of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, the ſentence being pronounced from God.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>For the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> It was not without weighty reaſon that <hi>Jude</hi> makes uſe of the Apoſtles teſtimony, and mentions the coming thereof from the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> and that in reſpect of <hi>Thoſe Apoſtles, Jude himſelfe, theſe Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>In reſpect of thoſe Apoſtles;</hi> by the mentioning of their foretelling of theſe <hi>Mockers, Jude</hi> ſhews the great care which thoſe faithfull ſervants of Chriſt had of the Churches welfare, their deſires being, that the Church ſhould get good by them, and live holily and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, when they had done living; and that they might by their writings, live even when they were dead, to be ſerviceable to the Church of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>reſpect of Jude himſelfe,</hi> he mentions the <hi>words of the Apoſtles,</hi> as to ſhew his humility in acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grace and gifts of God beſtowed upon others, ſo to ſhew the ſweet accord and agreement beween them and him in the doctrines which he delivered to them in this Epiſtle, concerning theſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers, that hereby he might gaine the more credit to himſelfe and preſent ſervice, there being a joint con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence
<pb n="556" facs="tcp:166919:284"/>between him and the other Apoſtles: as to this end he had before told the Chriſtians, that <hi>James</hi> was his <hi>brother</hi> in reſpect of <hi>parentage,</hi> ſo here he tells them that he and the other Apoſtles were brethren in reſpect of <hi>judgement and opinion;</hi> all the Apoſtles were ſtars enlightned by the ſame ſun, they drew the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of life out of the ſame fountain, pluckt the fruits of wholeſome doctrines off from the ſame tree; and by the producing of the teſtimony of ſo many others who witneſſed the ſame thing with him, he more clearly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>videnced that he had ſpoken nothing but the truth againſt theſe ſeducers, whom he had ſo ſharply repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In <hi>reſpect of the Chriſtians</hi> to whom he wrote: he mentions the Apoſtles, 1. To ſhew how <hi>zealous</hi> they ought to be againſt theſe ſeducers and their doctrines, in regard the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> who were ſo holy and unerring, had given the Chriſtians warning of them, and with ſuch vehemency ſpoken againſt them, as if they were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to leave hatred of error as their legacy, to their ſpiritual children.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To <hi>preſerve</hi> theſe Chriſtians againſt diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by ſeeing ſuch ungodly ſoul-ſubverting ſeducers, rage, and prevail in the Church; it being no other than <hi>what was foretold</hi> by thoſe who could not be deceived; and therefore they were not to look upon it as if ſome ſtrange thing had hapned to them.

                  <p>They are <hi>Watchmen,</hi> and its their duty to give war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of every enemy. They ſhould be unfaithfull to your ſouls, if they ſhould be friends to your adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Their loving and faithfull freeneſs herein creats them many enemies: but they can much more eaſily endure the wrath of man here for diſcharging, than the wrath of God hereafter for neglecting their duty. Its better that the luſts of ſeducers ſhould curſe them a while, then the ſouls of their people to all eternity. Miniſters muſt defend as well as feed their flock, and keep away poyſon as well as give them meat; drive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Wolfe, as well as provide paſture. Curſed be that patience which can ſee the Wolfe, and yet ſay nothing. If the hereſies of ſeducers be <hi>damnable,</hi> the ſilence of Miniſters muſt needs be ſo too.</p>

                     <hi>Its our duty to acknowledge and commend the gifts and graces of God beſtowed upon others, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect.

                  <p>How unſutable is it to the ſpirit of Chriſtianity, when meer ſhame compels a man to ſpeak ſomething in commendation of another, to come with a <hi>But</hi> in the concluſion of our commendation! <hi>But</hi> in ſuch or ſuch a thing he is faulty and defective.

                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. The <hi>laſt times</hi> are times of preſumption and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, and therefore of diſſoluteneſſe and impiety. In former times, judgments were threatned, the diſſolution and deſtruction of all things foretold; but becauſe the execution hereof is not beheld, therefore they who live in theſe times are encouraged to ſin. <hi>Becauſe ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence againſt their evill works is not ſpeedily executed,
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:166919:287"/>therefore are their hearts ſet to do evill.</hi> This ſecurity Chriſt foretells ſhould be in the <hi>laſt</hi> of the <hi>laſt dayes,</hi> namely, at his coming to judgment, as <hi>in the dayes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, &amp;c. ſo ſhall alſo the coming of the Son of man &amp;c.</hi> and this <hi>continuance of all things as they were from the beginning, occaſion'd theſe ſeducers, to ſcoff at the promiſe of his coming.</hi> 2. Pet. 3.4. The neerer they came to the <hi>feeling,</hi> the further they were from the <hi>fearing</hi> of puniſhment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. They who live in the <hi>laſt dayes,</hi> are more <hi>skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full practitioners</hi> in ſin, wittily wicked, underſtand more how to contrive ſin, and work iniquity, by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved experiences of their own and former times. Thus as 'tis in every other art, ſo likewiſe in that of ſinning, by length of time, cuſtome, and experience, tis improved to a greater degree of fineneſſe and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſſe; The ſinners of the <hi>laſt times</hi> are men, they of former times were but children in wickedneſſe. That <hi>old Serpent,</hi> the older he growes the more of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent he hath, and ſo it is with the ſeed of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. In the <hi>laſt times,</hi> the Kingdome of Jeſus Chriſt is more to be enlarged, and advanced, and therefore the malice of Satan is the more increaſed. As Chriſt riſeth in glory, ſo will Satan and ſinners more ſwell with rage and envy. Its ſaid, that thoſe people that live in places where the ſun is hotteſt and moſt ſcorch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, every morning curſe the riſing ſun; and thus in times where the Goſpel reacheth men with its holy heat and light, they curſe and malign it. Hatred is the <hi>genius</hi> of the Goſpel, and as wicked men the more raged at Chriſt the older he grew, ſo the more his Goſpell ſpreads the more the Devill deſpights it.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Laſtly. In the <hi>laſt times,</hi> the Devils time <hi>growes ſhort,</hi> and therefore his wrath <hi>growes great.</hi> Satan la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours to ſupply the ſhortneſſe of his time, with the

Satan now ſets upon ſoules by ſeduction the more furiouſly becauſe when theſe times are at an end, he ſhall never be ſuffered to doe ſo any more. Like a malicious tenant, who perceiving that his terme is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt expired, doth what he can to ruine the houſe; or like a bloody tyrant, who ſuſpecting the loſs of his uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped Soveraignty, makes havock among his ſubjects.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. Againſt <hi>man,</hi> and that for ſeveral cauſes. As</p>
                  <p n="1">1. For his <hi>Country:</hi> ſo ſome interpret that place. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.6. where God tels the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> that <hi>they have born the ſhame of the heathen.</hi> And ver. 15. that <hi>they ſhould not bear the reproach of the people any more.</hi> It ſeems that the heathen objected to the <hi>Jewes,</hi> the frequent ſterilities and famines of their land, (which we read of in Scripture) or the deſtructions and cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivities which for their ſins they had endured. <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate call'd Chriſt (by way of contempt) the <hi>Galilean;</hi> and (to ſome) it ſeems a contemptuous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Can there any good come out of Nazareth? Joh.</hi> 1.46.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For his <hi>poverty and meanneſs;</hi> Chriſt in and for
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:166919:290"/>his ſufferings was mocked, <hi>Mat.</hi> 20.19. and 27.29, 31 Thus <hi>Tobiah</hi> mocked the poor Jews, when building, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>If afox go up, he ſhal even break down their ſtone wal, Ne.</hi> 4.3.

                  <p n="3">3.

                  <p n="4">4.

Thus <hi>Feſtus</hi> tels <hi>Paul,</hi> that <hi>too much learning had made him mad, Acts</hi> 26.23. This ſort of mocking was that which the <hi>Babylonians</hi> expreſſed againſt the Jews in their captivity: <hi>Let us hear your Hebrew ſongs, Pſal.</hi> 137. ſuch (ſome conceive) was <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s <hi>mocking of Iſaak, Gen.</hi> 21.9. and this was that deriſion expreſſed againſt thoſe who had received the gifts of the holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. profane ſcoffers ſaying, that they were <hi>drunk with new wine.

                  <p n="2">2. Mocking (with higheſt impiety) is expreſſed <hi>againſt God himſelf;</hi> and that ſometimes as in reſpect of his works of judgment, ſo oftneſt of his word; as either commanding, reprehending, or threatning; thus when Chriſt had preached againſt covetouſneſſe, the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, <hi>who were covetous,</hi> derided him.

<pb n="569" facs="tcp:166919:290"/>when the Lord called the ſecure ſcorners to <hi>weeping and mourning, to baldneſſe and girding with ſackcloth; there was joy, and gladneſſe, ſlaying of oxen, and killing of ſheep, eating fleſh and drinking wine, &amp;c.</hi> When <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> Poſts went with letters to ſtir up <hi>Iſrael</hi> to celebrate the paſſeover at <hi>Jeruſalem, they were mocked.</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.10. Sad is the complaint of <hi>Jeremy, chap.</hi> 20.7, 8. <hi>I am in deriſion daily, every one mocketh me &amp;c.

I Doubt not but they mocked at dominions and dignities, at the holineſſe likewiſe and godly ſtrictneſs of theſe Chriſtians, as at a needleſſe and vain ſeverly;
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3 4.</note> but here <hi>Jude</hi> ſeems to run parallell with <hi>Peter,</hi> who tells us, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. that <hi>the mockers of the laſt times</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves ſuch, by deriding at the promiſe of Chriſts <hi>coming,</hi> they asking, <hi>where is the promiſe of his coming? for ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue as they were &amp;c.</hi> Theſe ſenſual Atheiſts, then <hi>tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the grace of God into wantoneſs,</hi> and giving over themſelves to the <hi>following of their luſts,</hi> ſecurely deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and ſcoft at any directions of holineſſe, or denun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations of judgements, which oppoſed them in their ungodly courſes, as vain and contemptible fables.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the <hi>ſecond, viz.</hi> the great ſinfulneſſe of <hi>moc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Its a ſin of unſpeakable <hi>profaneneſs,</hi> very hainous in reſpect of the glorious excellency of that God whom we mock. It is a great offence to mock man, a weak worme, a King, our parents; but to mock the great God, is a ſurpaſſing wickedneſſe. What doth the profane mocker, but (according to the meaning of his name) carry himſelf toward God, as if all his power,
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:166919:291"/>juſtice, threatnings, commands, ordinances, were childiſh toyes?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In reſpect of that groſſe <hi>unbelief</hi> which is in it; men are therefore <hi>mockers,</hi> becanſe they are <hi>unbelievers:</hi> threatnings, commands, promiſes are therefore <hi>deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded,</hi> becauſe they are <hi>diſtruſted. Where is the promiſe</hi> (ſaid theſe mockers) <hi>of his coming?</hi> all which the God of truth ſaith,
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.4.</note> is accounted but a notion, a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It argues the greateſt <hi>contempt</hi> of Gods <hi>long-ſuffering</hi> and <hi>forbearance.</hi> That goodneſs of God which ſhould <hi>lead to repentance,</hi> is to ſcorners a pillow of ſecurity; and what greater uningenuouſneſs, then to make God a ſufferer becauſe he makes not us to ſuffer, and to ſtrike him becauſe he ſtrikes not us, to fight againſt him with his own weapons?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. It makes all the <hi>means of grace ineffectuall;</hi> ſcor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners will not be better'd:
<note place="margin">Prov. 9.7, 8.</note> 
                     <hi>Rebuke a ſcorner, and he will hate thee;</hi> the ſtrength of this ſin makes all the helps of holineſſe to be but <hi>weak;</hi> they all ſlide off, as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from an oyld poſt. A ſcorner, is (as it were) a brazen wall, which beats back all the arrows of repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion. Mocking argues obdurateneſſe in ſin; It extinguiſheth light naturall, and oppoſeth light ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall.
<note place="margin">Pertinacem monere, eſt ſpeculum caeco objicere.</note> The admoniſhing of a ſcorner is the holding of a looking-glaſſe before a blind man, who indeed by his breath may blemiſh the glaſſe, but cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold himſelfe.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. It notes <hi>progreſſiveneſs in ſin,</hi> and the ariving even to the top of impiety: the beginnings of ſin are modeſt. Its bad to ſin (as at the firſt ſinners doe) though with bluſhing and concealment; but afterward by continuing in ſin, not only to grow inſenſible of it, to proclaim it, to maintain it, but to ſcorne all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs and threatnings againſt it; this ſhewes a ſinner is <hi>higher by the head and ſhoulders</hi> in ſin, than other men; and one who is gone ſo far in ungodlineſſe, that

<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.1.</note> when they looked upon me, they ſhaked their heads. Tertullian</hi> tells us, That the Chriſtians in his time, were mocked for ignorance. The Heathens painted the God of the Chriſtians with an Aſſes head, and a Book in his hand, to ſignifie, that though they pretended Learning, yet they were ſilly and unlearned people. Such who kept the Sabbath, were ſaid to have a Diſeaſe upon them, in regard whereof, they were fain to reſt once in the week. <hi>Athanaſius</hi> was called <hi>Sathanaſius,</hi> for being an Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the <hi>Arians. Cyprian</hi> was abuſed by the name of <hi>Coprian,</hi> one that gathers up dung. But why ſpeak I of the mockings which befel Chriſtians; they were the portion of Chriſt himſelf (as I have before ſhewed.) Our head was crowned with theſe thornes; they <hi>ſpit in his face, gave him a reed for a Scepter, bowed before him:</hi> Though he <hi>deſpiſed,</hi> yet he <hi>indured the ſhame, Hebr.</hi> 12.2. If mocking were the Dyet-drink of Chriſt ſhould not wee patiently taſte now and then a drop thereof? yea, none can bear ſo much contempt as God doth daily. Beſides, by impatience under ſcoffs we hurt our ſelves more then Scoffers can do. If we would not vex and diſturb our own ſouls by <hi>impatience,</hi> our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies could not hurt us by <hi>reproaches;</hi> and indeed, this ſelf-diſquieting is the only way to gratifie our enemies, whoſe alone aim by <hi>mocking</hi> is to trouble and diſturb us. And by fretfulneſs and rage we are liable to diſcover as much evil, as our enemies can diſcover by all their ſcoffs; and though wee are unjuſtly reproached, yet we may diſcover ſo much folly and paſſion, as to be a juſt cauſe of Reproach. We live among Reproachers, and Scof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers, and without patience we ſhall never have comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table lives, but the comfort and quiet of our lives will ever lye at the mercy of others. The greateſt evil of reproach is from him that receives it. As it is with meat, ſo it is with mockings: It is not the goodneſs and ſweetneſs of meat in it ſelf, that makes it to be good
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:166919:293"/>and ſweet to me; but ſo it is to me, as my ſtomack and body is affected; and ſcoffs and reproaches are not evils as they come from him that caſts them upon us, but the greateſt part of the evil of reproaches comes from the affection of the receiver. Further remember, there is more honour in bearing ſcoffs <hi>patiently,</hi> then there is <hi>diſgrace</hi> in having them caſt upon us <hi>wrongfully.</hi> Every fool can caſt a reproach, but onely the wiſe man can bear it well. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> tels us, That the <hi>Reproa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher</hi> is below a man, but the <hi>Patient</hi> under reproach, is equal to an Angel. Conſider likewiſe, that God takes the care of our <hi>names,</hi> as well as of our <hi>ſouls.</hi> When <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> enemies ſpake <hi>miſchievous things</hi> againſt him, hee tells us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.12, 13. that <hi>he heard not;</hi> but <hi>verſ.</hi> 15. he ſaith, that <hi>God hears.</hi> The leſs <hi>we</hi> hear, the more <hi>God</hi> will hear. They who <hi>mock</hi> here, ſhall bee <hi>mocked</hi> hereafter; and they who are here mocked, ſhall then be honoured. And how countervailing a mercy is it to be delivered from <hi>eternal</hi> Reproach! Meditate alſo how much contempt and mocking, many do juſtly ſuffer for their ſins. Many care not how much ſhame they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure in the ſervice of a baſe Luſt. Who are ſo baſely looked upon as the Drunkards, Covetous? and yet they go on, and bleſſe themſelves, notwithſtanding their reproach. What cauſe have we then to go on in the wayes of God, though all the world mock us! Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider alſo what honour God hath put upon thee for the preſent. He hath (if thou art Godly) brought thee to the honourable eſtate of Sonſhip, and hath put his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon thy ſoul, and hath honoured thee by that neer relation thou haſt to Chriſt. How baſe was <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> ſpirit, who being ſo honoured by the King, was ſo vexed becauſe <hi>Mordecai</hi> would not bow to him! And truly it is a ſinful baſeneſs in Saints, that when God hath raiſed them to ſuch glory, as to be <hi>members</hi> of, and <hi>coheirs</hi> with his Son, and hath provided for them the glory of Heaven: yet for all this, when they have but a
<pb n="575" facs="tcp:166919:293"/>mock from men, to be ſo diſcouraged and caſt down, as if all the honour that God had put upon them were no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. Think likewiſe how much <hi>religion</hi> hath been ſcoft at for your ſake: and is it ſo great a matter for you to be mocked for religion? <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſaith, that <hi>when for us our Lord is blaſphemed, 'tis worſe then if we periſhed.</hi> Conſider alſo the goodneſſe of God in keeping in thoſe many ſecret wickedneſſes of thy heart from appearing, which had they been ſuffered by God to break forth, would have been matter enough of ſcorn and reproach, whereas now the enemies are fain to watch, and pry, and pump for ſome occaſion, &amp; yet can hardly find any. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo that there is more danger in being <hi>honored,</hi> then <hi>contemned</hi> by men. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaid, his greateſt <hi>fear</hi> was the <hi>praiſe</hi> of men, &amp; that reproach was his joy, and that he would not have the glory &amp; fame of <hi>Eraſmus.</hi> Laſtly, The bearing of ſcoffs <hi>patiently</hi> is a great help to our progreſs in godlineſſe: As they who have overcome the evil of ſhame in a way of <hi>ſin,</hi> grow <hi>hardned</hi> in ſin; ſo they who regard no reproach caſt upon them for holineſſe, will much proceed therein. And that we may beare the cruelleſt mockings patiently, 1.

In that ſhe did thruſt the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> the great and onely teacher of the church out of the chair, and in it, placed the <hi>Pope</hi> as the infallible Doctor of the church, to whom ſhe ties her beliefe; and ſubjects her faith,

The <hi>Scriptures</hi> (the alone rule of faith) the Romaniſts ſlight and impiouſly deſpiſe, and make them an inſufficient rule of faith, by joyning their over-fond and falſe traditions to it, by preferring a vitious and <hi>barbarous</hi> interpretation before the ſacred originals, by making the holy Scriptures to have neither life, nor ſoul, nor voice, till the interpretation of the church (or rather the <hi>Pope</hi>) be added. 3. <hi>They have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved</hi> the great and main article of faith, concerning the <hi>juſtification</hi> of a ſinner, the nature whereof though the Scripture makes to ſtand in the remiſſion of ſinnes, and the application of Chriſts righteouſneſſe by faith, yet they aſcribe it partly to Chriſts, and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to our own merits and righteouſneſſe, in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect that of the Apoſtle ſutes with them. <hi>Chriſt is become of no effect to you who are juſtified by the law.</hi> 4.

Let them conſider, whither the want of the exact purging and reforming of theſe abuſes proceed not rather from ſome <hi>unhappy obstructions</hi> and politicall reſtrictions (whether or no cauſed by thoſe who make
<pb n="591" facs="tcp:166919:301"/>this objection, God knowes) in the exerciſe of diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, then from the allowance or neglect of the Church it ſelfe. Nay 3. Let them conſider whether when they ſeparate for ſinfull mixtures, the Church be not at that very time <hi>purging out</hi> thoſe ſinfull mixtures: and is that a time to make a ſeparation from a Church by departing from it, when the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Chriſt are making a ſeparation in that Church by reforming of it? But 4. Let it be ſeriouſly weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that ſome ſinfull mixtures are not a ſufficient cauſe of ſeparation from a Church. Hath not God his Church even where corruption of manners hath crept into a Church, if purity of doctrine be maintained? and is ſeparation from that Church lawful, from which God doth not ſeparate? did the Apoſtle, becauſe of the ſinful mixturess in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> direct the fuithful to ſeparate? Muſt not he who will forbeare communion with a Church, till it be altogether freed from mixtures, tarry till the day of judgment? til when, we have no promiſe that Chriſt will gather out of his Church <hi>whatſoever doth offend.</hi> 5. Let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether God hath made <hi>private Chriſtians ſtew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards in his houſe,</hi> to determine whether thoſe with whom they communicate, are fit members of the Church or not; or rather, whether it be not their duty when they diſcover <hi>tares</hi> in the Church, in ſtead of ſeparating from it, to labour that they may be found <hi>good corne,</hi> that ſo when God ſhall come to gather his corn into his garner, they may not be thrown out? Church-officers are miniſterially betruſted with the ordering of the Church, and for the opening and ſhutting of the doors of the Churches Communion, by the Keyes of doctrine and diſcipline; and herein if they ſhall either be hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred or negligent, private Chriſtians ſhall not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangled in the guilt of their ſin, if they be humbled, and uſe all lawful means for remedy, though they do communicate. 6. Let them ſearch whether there be
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:166919:302"/>any <hi>Scripture warrant,</hi> to break off communion with the Church in the ordinances, when there is no defect in the <hi>ordinances themſelves,</hi> only upon this ground, becauſe ſome are admitted to them, who becauſe of their perſonal miſcarriages, ought to be debarred. The Jewes of old, though they ſeparated when the worſhip it ſelf was corrupted, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 11.14, 16. yet not becauſe wicked men were ſuffered to be in outward com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with them, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 7.9, 10. nor do the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts or patterns of the Chriſtian Churches for caſting out of offenders, give any liberty to ſeparation in caſe of failing to caſt them out; and though the ſuffering of ſcandalous perſons be blamed, yet not the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating with them.
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.11. Rev. 2.14.15.20.24.</note> The command <hi>not to eat</hi> with a brother who is a fornicator or covetous &amp;c. concerns not <hi>religious,</hi> but <hi>civil</hi> communion, by a voluntary, familiar, intimate Converſation, either in being invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted or in inviting, as is clear by theſe two Arguments. 1. <hi>That eating which is here forbidden with a brother, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be with an heathen;</hi> but its the <hi>civil</hi> eating which is onely allowed to be with a heathen; therefore its the civil eating which is forbidden to be with a brother. 2. <hi>The eating</hi> here forbidden, is for the puniſhment of the <hi>nocent,</hi> not for a puniſhment to the <hi>innocent;</hi> but if religious eating at the Sacrament were forbidden, the greateſt <hi>puniſhment</hi> would fall upon the innocent, the godly. Now though ſuch civil eating was to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne; yet it follows not at all, much leſſe much more, that religious eating is forbidden, 1. Becauſe civil ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting is arbitrary and unneceſſary, not ſo religious, which is enjoyned, and a commanded duty. 2. There is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of being infected by the wicked in civil, familiar, and arbitrary eatings; not ſo injoyning with them in an holy and commanded ſervice and ordinance. 3. Civill eating is done out of love either to the party inviting, or invited, but religious is done out of love to Jeſus Chriſt, were it not for whom, we would neither eat at
<pb n="593" facs="tcp:166919:302"/>Sacrament with wicked men, nor at all.</p>
                  <p>To conclude this, ſeparation from Churches, from which Chriſt doth not ſeparate, is ſchiſmatical; now its clear in the Scripture, that Chriſt owneth churches where faith is ſound for the ſubſtance, and their worſhip, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-worſhip, though there be many defects and ſinfull mixtures among them And what I have ſaid concerning the ſchiſmaticalneſſe of ſeparation becauſe of the ſinfull mixtures of thoſe who are wicked in practiſe, is as true concerning ſeparation from them who are <hi>erroneous in judgement;</hi> if the errours of thoſe from whom the ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration is made, be not fundamental, and hinder Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Chriſt the head. And much more clear, (if clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer can be) is the <hi>ſchiſmaticalneſſe</hi> of thoſe who ſeparate from and renounce all Communion with thoſe chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, which are not of their <hi>own manner of Conſtitution,</hi> and modeld according to the platform of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular church-order. To refrain fellowſhip, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with ſuch Churches who profeſſe Chriſt their Lord, whoſe faith is ſound, whoſe worſhip is Goſpel-worſhip, whoſe lives are holy, becauſe they come not into that particular way of church-order which we have pitcht upon, is a ſchiſmaticall rending of the church of Chriſt to pieces.

Herein likewiſe thoſe ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts among our ſelves are heniouſly faulty who cenſure and condemn all other churches, though their faith, worſhip, and converſation be never ſo ſcriptural, meerly becauſe they are not gathered into church order, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own patterns.

A <hi>progreſſiveneſſe</hi> and proceeding therein, even to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and all theſe are aptly applicable to that ſpiritual purpoſe of our apoſtle in this place: for by this expreſſion he intends to put them upon labouring for <hi>confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and ſtability in their Chriſtian courſe by ſitting faſt to the word, the <hi>foundation of faith,</hi> and as a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which is firmely fixed and immoveably ſet upon its foundation, ſtedfaſtly to abide in and reſt upon the truth of the word; that all the winds, and waves and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of ſeducers may not be able to unſettle and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move them.

                     </gap>, <hi>built up;</hi> in which he exhorts the Chriſtians to ſtability in Chriſt and his truth, by being joyned to him as the buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding is to the foundation; and hence it is that Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.24. commended the wiſedome of that man, who <hi>built his houſe upon the rock,</hi> and ver. 26. blamed the folly of him who <hi>built his houſe upon the ſand.</hi> He <hi>that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth my words</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man that built his houſe upon the rock.</hi> The firm and unfeined belief of the doctrine of faith is as the reſting and depending upon the rock or foundation.

And hence it is, that as Chriſt is in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, called a <hi>foundation,</hi> Eph. 2.10. <hi>the chief corner-ſtone, a ſtone for a foundation,</hi> and beſides whom, <hi>no other foundation can be layd,</hi> 2 Cor. 3.11.

                     <note place="margin">Mat. 16.18.</note> we are to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand their doctrines; and the way to build upon Chriſt, is by building upon his word as our foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: for Chriſt is not a foundation of happineſſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way that man frames in his own heart; but onely ſo as God offers him in the word of the Goſpel; and Chriſt makes it all one to build and beleeve on his word as on himſelfe. <hi>He that refuſeth me, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth not my word,</hi> Joh. 12.48. <hi>And if ye abide in me and my words abide in you.</hi> Joh. 5.17.

                  <p n="2">2. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The Apoſtle by this phraſe of <hi>building up,</hi> puts the Chriſtians upon a <hi>right ordering</hi> of the materialls and parts of the building: for in the building the materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alls are not onely to be <hi>laid,</hi> but <hi>skilfully to</hi> be laid upon the foundation: and this comprehends <hi>two</hi> things. 1.

All the parts muſt be diſpoſed, and contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the beſt advantage of, and ſo as they may be <hi>moſt uſefull to the dweller.</hi> Every grace muſt be <hi>for</hi> God, as it is <hi>from</hi> him. Who builds an houſe and doth not expect to be accommodated and benefited by it? 3. There muſt be a <hi>due proportion</hi> between part and part, and ſuch a laying out of the one, that there may not be too great an abridgment or hindering of the beauty and largeneſſe of the other. Chriſtians muſt have all the parts of holineſſe and parcells of grace. There muſt not be ſo much alotted for one roome, that nothing be left for another; a Chriſtian muſt not be all for <hi>knowledge,</hi> and nothing for <hi>Love;</hi> all for <hi>zeal,</hi> and nothing for <hi>humility;</hi> all for <hi>humility</hi> nothing for <hi>courage.</hi> A Chriſtian muſt neither be maimed, nor monſtrous. 4 All the parts muſt be built <hi>according to the line and rule</hi> of the word.

I have very largely diſcourſed thereof Part. 1. pag. 92. on thoſe words, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to you.</hi> To avoid needleſſe repetition, I only ſay, that <hi>mercy</hi> as attributed to <hi>man</hi> is ſuch a ſympathy or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of heart as enclines us to relieve the miſerable.</p>
                  <p>But as attributed to <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> (in glory, as here) it notes either, 1. A gracious diſpoſition or inclination to help and ſuccour us in our diſtreſſes.

The effects and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsions of mercy, or the actual helping of us out of our diſtreſſes; and ſo God is ſaid <hi>to have mercy on us,</hi> and <hi>ſhew mercy to us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now theſe effects of mercy, are either <hi>common</hi> or <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial.

And thus mercy is principally to be taken in this place, and that peculiarly for thoſe gracious expreſſions and diſcoveries of mercy, w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> ſhall be ſhewn toward the faithful in acquitting and delivering them at Chriſts ſecond coming, or coming to judgment. And this is called <hi>mercy</hi> in ſcripture, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.18. where the Apoſtle ſpeaking of <hi>Oneſiphorus,</hi> prayes that he may find <hi>mercy of the Lord in that day.</hi> And deſervedly its ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                  <p n="2">2. In it there are the greateſt <hi>effects and diſcoveries</hi> of mercy. A removal of all bad, ſin, ſorrow, tears, tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; outward, inward, eternal evils. Woes from our ſelves, other men, devils, God himſelfe. A confluence of all good, of perfect grace in the ſoul, glory on the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and ſoule.

The wife that <hi>lookes</hi> for the returne of her wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come husband, ſpends her thoughts upon him; by this time (thinks ſhe) he is come to ſuch a place, to night he lodgeth in ſuch an houſe. The thoughts of ſaints run upon this mercy of Chriſt.
<note place="margin">Heb. 11. Pſal. 39. 1 Pet. 1.</note> The reaſon why they are call'd <hi>ſtrangers</hi> here, is, becauſe they dwell ſo much in their thoughts of another condition. Every ſaint is made to looke <hi>upwards. Beneficiall</hi> and <hi>great</hi> things are much thought on. The covetous man thinks of his treaſure, the labourer of his hire, the priſoner of his enlargement, the heir of his poſſeſſion. And <hi>great</hi> things are greatly obſerved, and ſerious matters ſeriouſly regarded. Trivial toyes and enjoyments cannot hinder a ſaint from the thoughts of this great mercy; yea all other things are but ſo many ſteps to raiſe his meditation to it. Wicked men are bow'd downward in their contemplation, as in their conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Saints are low in the latter, high in the former. They are as unlike, as a piece of dirt, and a ball. Caſt dirt upon the earth, it lies ſtill, caſt a ball on it, and it rebounds upward.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Belief of this mercy.</hi> The <hi>looking for this mercy</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports a groundedneſſe of expectation. A ſaint looks for nothing without the foundation of a promiſe. Faith certainly layes hold on that certaine word;
<note place="margin">Heb. 6.11.19.</note> and hence <hi>hope</hi> hath ſuch a certainty as never makes <hi>us aſhamed.</hi> There's a <hi>full aſſurance of hope,</hi> call'd therefore the <hi>ſure and ſtedfaſt anchor of the ſoule.</hi> This expectation is not overcome by humane ſenſe and reaſon,
<note place="margin">Heb. 11.1.</note> but climbs above them. Faith gives a reality to things <hi>not ſeen.</hi> This <hi>looking</hi> is for that which is clean contrary to ſenſe. Its an <hi>hope above hope:</hi> they who have it, ſee the mercy of Chriſts coming even through a cloud of ſin and miſery, and <hi>look at things within the vaile.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 6.19.</note>

They make not <hi>haſt, Iſa.</hi> 28.16. Though they dwell in an unkind world, and among them that <hi>hate peace.</hi> Though they are wounded with croſſes, yet they ſay with <hi>Auguſtine, Lord, here burn, wound, cut,</hi> the mercie of Chriſt makes amends for all. Though they are environed with a body of death, and had infinitely rather (if God pleaſed) change a <hi>neceſſity of ſinning for a neceſſity of obeying,</hi> yet they contentedly think Gods time is the beſt for removing, though the worſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils. Their patience concocts their miſeries, and their empty ſtomaks keep them from being ſick, though in a wide and ſtormy ſea.
<note place="margin">Rom. 8.21.</note> 
                     <hi>Through faith and patience they inherit the promiſes,</hi> Heb. 6.12. This <hi>looking for the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Chriſt,</hi> is, 2 Theſ. 3.5. called <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p n="5">5. This looking conteins in it a <hi>joyful expectation</hi> of that great good for which we look. Though the deferring makes the <hi>heart ſad and ſick;</hi> yet the expecting thereof makes the heart glad and cheerful. <hi>Wee rejoyce under
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:166919:326"/>the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2 <hi>In whom believing, we rejoyce with joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> 1 Pet, 1.8.

                  <p n="6">6.

Hence <hi>Luke, Luk.</hi> 12.36, 37. makes this <hi>looking</hi> and <hi>watching</hi> all one. They who look for an <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy</hi> will watch to prevent his coming (as Chriſt ſpeaks of the theif.) They who look for a friend, will watch to welcome and entertain him. All who <hi>look for mercy,</hi> la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour to be found in <hi>peace,</hi> they look up as watchmen upon their Tower, they keep their <hi>loyns girt</hi> and they are in the poſture of ſervants expecting their Lord, they are afraid of ſurfets and ſleeping by worldly pleaſures They who reach after this mercy muſt let worldly trifles fall out of their hand.
<note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.11.</note> The better the mercy to be enjoyed is, the fitter we ſhould be to receive. A prepared mercy ſutes not with an unprepared heart. Every day to a ſaint ſhould be as his laſt. And of every one he ſhould ſay, art thou the laſt, <hi>or look I for another?</hi> Am I now in a <hi>meet</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture to receive <hi>the mercy</hi> of Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>To ſhut up this, it is not ſtrange that <hi>Jude</hi> enjoins theſe Saints to <hi>look</hi> for this <hi>mercy</hi> of Chriſt, conſidering the <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tablenes</hi> of this exhortation to the perſons exhorted, who 1. are Saints, ſuch as have the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> which ſaith <hi>Come,</hi> whoſe motions are upward, who are <hi>begotten again to this lively hope,</hi> who (as they are men) look upward with their faces, ſo (as they are Saints and <hi>new men,</hi>) look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward with their ſpirits, and <hi>wait for Chriſt from heaven,</hi> 1 Theſ. 1.10. <hi>and love his appearance,</hi> 2.

(much leſſe) to ſooth and flatter ſinners in their errours and impieties. A wickednes which is in ſcripture frequently charged upon, and reproved

                  <p>But by this <hi>ſhewing of compaſſion</hi> toward <hi>ſome</hi> of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenders, hee intends an endeavour in convincing of, and reproving for ſinne, to reduce them from their falls and follies, in a mild, gentle, meek manner, and a mixing or ſeaſoning all the meanes uſed for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction and repentance, with Chriſtian gentleneſſe and ſweetneſſe, ſo as the offender may not be ſwallowed up of grief &amp; diſpair. The ſame counſel is given by <hi>Paul,</hi> Gal. 6. namely, <hi>of reſtoring a faln brother in the ſpirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe,</hi> and 2 Tim. 2.25. <hi>of inſtructing thoſe who oppoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in meekneſſe.</hi> In the former place <hi>Paul</hi> bids them <gap reason="foreign">

Commonly men are either too <hi>remiſſe</hi> if thy endeavour gentleneſſe, or too <hi>auſtere,</hi> if labour for faithfulneſſe. But it muſt be with a reprover as with a <hi>Chirurgian,</hi> who binds not up the wound either <hi>duriter</hi> or <hi>ſegniter,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Nec duriter, nec ſegniter.</note> either too ſlack or too hard; This Chriſtian gentleneſſe ſhews it ſelfe toward the offender in reſtoring him, ſeveral wayes. 1. Buy por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding a reproofe in <hi>our own perſon,</hi> and declaring how great a ſinne it would have been for our ſelves to have done thus or thus. So <hi>Paul</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6. <hi>Theſe things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have in a figure transferr'd to my ſelfe and to Apollo for your ſakes,</hi> that by this wiſe way, hee might reprove them and their teachers in making of ſects and factions. 2. By conveying the ſharpeſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs in <hi>ſweet</hi> and <hi>gentle</hi> words, and accompanying them with courteous carriage. The pill of a reprehenſion is
<pb n="645" facs="tcp:166919:331"/>to be gilded and ſugred over with gentleneſſe: ſoft words do beſt with ſtrong arguments. The <hi>iron of Nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalies</hi> foot was <hi>dipt in oyl.</hi> 3. By conveying the reproof in a <hi>parable,</hi> as <hi>Nathan</hi> did in his convincing <hi>David</hi> of his ſinne. Who hereby was made his own judge, and ſpared the Prophet the unpleaſing paines of a large ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. 4. By perſwading the reprehended of <hi>our love</hi> to their perſons, and convincing them that tis not the perſon who hath ſinned, but the ſinne of the perſon which we ſtrike at. A man will take any thing from one that loves him. A Chirurgion wee will not ſtrike, though he cut us deep, whereas we will not endure half thoſe wounds from a murderer, without returning ſtroke for ſtroke. 5. By mixing hopes of pardon with the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereſt reprehenſions and denunciations. When God had humbled <hi>Adam,</hi> hee concludes with the promiſe of <hi>the ſeed of the woman.</hi> Thus <hi>Joſeph</hi> dealt with his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren when he had humbled them.

Of this ſee more, Part. 2. pag. 152. Difference is to be put between thoſe of more <hi>ſoft, tender,</hi> and humble diſpoſitions, and thoſe who are more rugged and pertinacious. A <hi>Venice</hi>-glaſſe is not to be rub'd ſo hard as an iron or braſſe-veſſel. A word will do more with ſome then a blow will do with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

                  <p>Two things are here briefly to be explained.</p>

                     <item>2. How and why it was to be hated.</item>
                  </list>
                  <p n="1">1. For the firſt, <hi>the garment ſpotted with the fleſh.</hi> Many impertinent and overcurious expoſitions by Popiſh wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are given us of this place, ſome underſtand this <hi>gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſpotted by the fleſh, properly</hi> as if <hi>Jude</hi> intended that the filthy uncleanneſs and obſcenities of theſe impure ſinners, did not only defile their manners and actions, but
<pb n="667" facs="tcp:166919:342"/>even their very clothes &amp; garments, by reaſon of their nearneſs to their defiled fleſh, and even theſe (ſay they) <hi>Jude</hi> bids theſe Chriſtians to ſhun or not touch, to ſhew their hatred of carnal uncleanneſſe.
<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Levior mihi ſenſus videtur quam ut gravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatem Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licam deceat.</hi> Juſtinian. <hi>in loc.</hi>
                     </note> But <hi>Juſtinian</hi> ſeems rightly to conceive that this is an expoſition of more lightneſs then to ſavour of apoſtolical gravity. Others by this <hi>garment</hi> underſtand that natural unholineſſe which <hi>Paul</hi> calls the <hi>old man with his deeds,</hi> and commands the Chriſtians to <hi>put off</hi> as an old filthy garment, Col. 3.9.</p>
                  <p>But this is not agreeable to the ſcope of the Apoſtle, which is not to direct the Chriſtians what to put off from, and hate <hi>in</hi> themſelves, but to ſhun and hate that which might bee conveyed from others <hi>to</hi> themſelves. The beſt expoſition is that given by learned <hi>Calvin,</hi> and ſome others, who ſay that by this <hi>garment ſpotted by the fleſh,</hi> the Apoſtle intends that which ſeems to have any affinity or neerneſſe to the vices of theſe ſinners which were among them. And this is very much confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, 1. by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, here tranſlated <hi>(even)</hi> which (as <hi>Calvin</hi> notes) <hi>ad amplificationem valet,</hi> hath the <hi>force of amplification,</hi> and imports as if the Apoſtle had ſaid in a full ſpeech, <hi>hating not onely the fleſh it ſelfe, but even the garment ſpotted or infected by the fleſh,</hi> and alſo 2. by that apt alluſion which in theſe <hi>metaphorical</hi> expreſsions, <hi>Jude</hi> makes unto that commanded rite of the ceremonial law, whereby the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> were ceremonially unclean, not onely by touching the fleſh of one who had a run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning iſſue, or the matter it ſelfe that iſſued forth, but even by touching the ſeat, bed, ſaddle, garments of ſuch a perſon, <hi>Levit.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6, 17. &amp;c. ſo that this direction of <hi>hating the garment ſpotted by the fleſh, imports as much as if Jude</hi> had ſaid, Know Oh Chriſtians, though I have exhorted you to have compaſsion of the perſons of theſe ſinners, and to labour with them that they might bee pluckt out of their miſerable eſtate yet I would have you warily to take heed to your ſelves, leſt while you are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the curing of them, they infect you, and leſt that
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:166919:343"/>while you lend them your hand to draw them out of the pit, they being ſtronger then you, pull you in to them. Nay, ſo far muſt you be from allowing and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their groſſe and ungodly practices, that you muſt abſtaine from whatever hath any neighbourhood or nearneſſe to their ſins. For not onely would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have you kept from touching the infecting and defiling fleſh, the ſin it ſelfe; but I exhort you to hate even the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cloathes, or that which fits any thing near to it, or borders upon it, or hath affinity to it. And this directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on principally comprehends two particulars.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That they ſhould hate all <hi>incentives, occaſions,</hi> inducements or inlets to ſin, and that both in reſpect of themſelves, and others. 1. In reſpect of <hi>themſelves.</hi> Its ſafeſt keeping far from the brinke of the river. He who bath fallen, and yet will walke in ſlippery places, ſhewes that (yet) he hath not been bruiſed enough. Thus <hi>Eves</hi> looking on the apple, ſo as that it drew on her appetite; her parly with the Serpent ſhould have been avoided. 2. In reſpect of <hi>others. Paul</hi> was very carefull to avoid occaſions of making others ſin, though things which he avoided were neither ſinfull in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor to him. <hi>Pauls</hi> eating of fleſh was lawfull in it ſelfe, and lawfull to him, and yet rather then he would offend his weak brother,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.13. Rom. 14.21. Gal 4.19.</note> he would never doe it <hi>while the world ſtands. Paul</hi> was ſometimes here <hi>travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling in birth</hi> with <hi>his little children,</hi> and was like a careful mother that is with child, who forbears many meats for fear of doing her childe hurt. Thus <hi>Paul,</hi> refuſed to circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi> fearing the confirmation of the Jews in their errour. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.3.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That they ſhould avoid that which carries a ſhew of evill, and is liable to miſconſtruction. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> refuſed the uſing his liberty in taking a lawfull mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for his labours, leſt a ſiniſter interpretation of covetouſneſſe and mercenary affection ſhould have been put upon it by his adverſaries. Though here it
<pb n="669" facs="tcp:166919:343"/>muſt be noted, that in all neceſſary duties, we muſt yield abſolute obedience to God, though to the world it appear never ſo evill. Chriſt preached himſelfe the <hi>bread of life,</hi> though the Jewes were offended, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. <hi>Daniel</hi> will pray <hi>three times</hi> a day, though it coſt him his life. <hi>John</hi> will preach againſt <hi>Herodias,</hi> though all the Court be offended. For though evill muſt not be done that good may come of it, yet good muſt be don though evill may come of it. Thus in doctrine wee muſt abſtaine from ſuch ſpeeches, which though they may have a right interpretation,
<note place="margin">Haereticorum vocabula ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menda.</note> yet carry a ſhew of evill. To ſay we are <hi>ſaved by works,</hi> may have a true interpretation, but its better to abſtaine from it, becauſe it hath an appearance of popiſh merit. To call Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall Miniſters <hi>Prieſts</hi> may be truly expounded, but it were better to avoid the expreſſion, becauſe of the ſhew of Popiſh ſacrifice and prieſthood. The words of hereticks are to be avoided. And if we will keep the <hi>faith</hi> of the ſcriptures, we muſt keep the <hi>words</hi> of the ſcriptures. Thoſe things which are <hi>malè colorata,</hi> though not <hi>in ſe mala,</hi> which have an ill colour, though not an ill nature, muſt be ſhun'd.</p>

His <hi>honour</hi> is hereby advanced. The farther we keep from defiling our ſelves, the more we keep from diſhonouring him. Its the glory of the Goſpel, when men cannot lay any thing like an evill to our charge, and when they cannot ſpeak reproachful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and truly at the ſame time. 3. His <hi>example</hi> is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by imitated. He hates all thats evill and like evill. The conformity of our affections with the Lord is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry acceptable. <hi>How</hi> highly is the Church of <hi>Epheſus</hi> commended for <hi>hating the doctrine of the Nicholaitans,
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:166919:344"/>which</hi> (ſaith the Lord) <hi>I alſo hate.</hi> There is in God no ſhadow of change, and therefore nothing like ſinne: <hi>He is of purer eyes then to behold ſin or to look upon iniquity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Themſelves.</hi> 1. It is a true note of <hi>ſincerity</hi> to ſhun evil in its very likeneſſe. He who hates a perſon, loves not his very picture. This is a main difference betweene a ſound Chriſtian and an hypocrite. A wicked man will abſtain from evil in extreams, but commonly hee cares not for petty and appearing evils. Hence, tell him of ſuch and ſuch a ſinne, his reply uſually is, give me ſome plain manifeſt ſcriptures againſt it, ſcriptures which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe his ſinne by conſequence and proportion will not ſerve the turn. It muſt onely be a plain bare-faced evill that he will forſake. An hypocrite loves the appearance of good more than goodneſſe it ſelfe; the godly hates the very <hi>appearance of evil,</hi> as well as the evil it ſelfe. 2 Its his <hi>wiſedome</hi> to avoid the <hi>appearance of evil.</hi> Hee who will never give way to ſo much as an <hi>appearing,</hi> ſhall not be overthrown with a real evil. Hee who will not touch, will not taſte, much leſſe ſwallow down a ſinne. And hee who cares not to avoid the appearance of evil, by little and little cometh to eſteeme the evil and the appearance both alike: the beginnings of ſinne are mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt, and yet make way to immodeſt proceedings. 3. He takes the wiſeſt courſe to preſerve his <hi>good name,</hi> he who abſtains from appearing evils, provides for his conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reputation at once; and ſtops the mouths of accuſers abroad, as well as of the accuſer in his owne boſome.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>Others,</hi> 1. The <hi>weake.</hi> 2. The <hi>wicked.</hi> 1. They who ſhunne the very reſemblance of ſinne. make thoſe who are any thing inclinable to follow them, more exact and preciſe in their walking. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ommonly if a leader will adventure upon an appearing, a follower will be imboldned thereby to commit a real evil: for though when we behold men ſtrict in holineſſe, we are too ready to hope that we may bee allowed to come a
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:166919:345"/>little ſhort of them, yet when wee ſee any take liberty to do that which enclines to evil, wee are prone to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that we may go a little beyond them. They who write copyes muſt write a fair hand; trifles in a leader are blaſphemies. As reports loſe nothing in the telling, ſo ſinne loſeth nothing in the imitating.

A note of <hi>aſſent,</hi> and therefore it was not uſed onely by the Jewes at prayer, but at the Sermons and Expoſitions delivered by the Rabbins, to teſtifie that the people aſſented, and agreed to all that they taught. Hence <hi>Amen</hi> may not unfitly be call'd (as it were) a kinde of audible ſubſcription. Thus the Apoſtle
<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.16.</note> directs the Chriſtians to ſpeake in a known tongue, that the <hi>unlearn'd</hi> underſtanding what he heareth, may give his aſſent to it by ſaying, <hi>Amen.</hi> 2. It importeth earneſt deſire. Hence
